### 6.2 Cyber security and privacy rights ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: This topic covers the fundamental principles of protecting yourself and your personal information in the digital world. A failure in cybersecurity can lead to direct, tangible harm like data theft, financial loss, or your accounts being compromised. Understanding your privacy rights is essential to controlling your digital footprint and preventing your personal information from being exploited.

While netiquette covers the social rules of the internet, cybersecurity and privacy rights form the legal and ethical foundation of your digital life. **Cybersecurity** is your _responsibility_ to defend your digital assets, while **Privacy** is your fundamental _right_ to control your personal information.

### Cybersecurity: Your Digital Self-Defense üõ°Ô∏è

**Cybersecurity** is the practice of protecting your computers, devices, and data from unauthorized access, theft, or damage. It's an ethical duty not only to protect yourself but also to prevent your devices from being used to harm others.

#### Common Threats You Must Recognize

- **Malware**: Short for "malicious software," this is a category of software designed to cause harm. It includes:
    
    - **Viruses**: Programs that infect other files and spread throughout your computer.
        
    - **Ransomware**: A particularly nasty type of malware that encrypts all your files, making them inaccessible until you pay a ransom.
        
    - **Spyware**: Software that secretly monitors your activity and steals information like passwords and credit card numbers.
        
- **Phishing** üé£: This is the most common type of cyberattack. It is a fraudulent attempt, usually made through email, to trick you into revealing sensitive information. The email might look like it's from a legitimate source (like your bank, university, or a social media site) and will try to create a sense of urgency to get you to click a malicious link or open a dangerous attachment.
    

#### Essential Cybersecurity Practices

1. **Use Strong, Unique Passwords**: A strong password is long (12+ characters) and uses a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Most importantly, **do not reuse the same password** for multiple important accounts.
    
2. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: This is one of the most effective security measures you can take. It adds a second layer of security, typically a code sent to your phone, to your login process. This means even if a hacker steals your password, they can't access your account.
    
3. **Keep Your Software Updated**: Always install updates for your operating system (Windows), web browser, and other applications. These updates frequently contain critical patches for security vulnerabilities.
    
4. **Think Before You Click**: Be suspicious of unsolicited emails. Look for red flags like generic greetings ("Dear User"), poor grammar, and urgent threats ("Your account will be suspended!"). Hover your mouse over links to see the actual web address before you click.
    
5. **Use Security Software**: Ensure your antivirus software, like the built-in **Microsoft Defender**, is always running and up to date.

### Privacy Rights: Your Right to Control Your Data üîí

**Digital Privacy** is your right to control what personal information is collected about you, how it is used, and with whom it is shared.

#### Your Rights and How to Exercise Them

- **The Right to Know**: Companies and websites should inform you about what data they collect. This information is usually found in a "Privacy Policy."
    
- **The Right to Control**: You have the right to manage your digital footprint. You can exercise this right by:
    
    - **Managing Privacy Settings**: Regularly go into the privacy and security settings of your social media accounts (Facebook, Instagram, etc.), your Google account, and your web browser. Control who can see your posts, what information you share, and how your data is used for advertising.
        
    - **Being Selective**: Be mindful of the information you share online. Don't post sensitive personal data like your full address, phone number, or student ID number in public forums.
        
    - **Limiting App Permissions**: When you install a new app, be critical of the permissions it requests. Does a simple game really need access to your contacts and microphone?
        

#### Your Duty to Respect Others' Privacy

Privacy is a two-way street. It is your ethical responsibility to respect the privacy of others. This means:

- Never accessing someone else's email, social media, or computer without their permission.
    
- Never sharing someone's private photos, messages, or personal information without their explicit consent.
    
- Not using technology to secretly track or monitor someone.
