Of course. Let's cover the essential topic of connectivity in Windows.

### 2.5 Connectivity ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: In today's world, a computer's power is fully unlocked when it's connected. Mastering the ability to connect to Wi-Fi for internet access and to pair Bluetooth peripherals for a wireless experience is a fundamental, non-negotiable skill. This knowledge is essential for research, communication, and creating an efficient, cable-free workspace.

**Connectivity** in the Windows environment refers to the computer's ability to establish connections with networks (like the internet) and with other nearby devices. Windows provides a user-friendly interface to manage these connections, primarily through the **Settings** app and quick access panels on the taskbar.

#### Connecting to a Wi-Fi Network 📶

This is the most common way laptops and mobile devices connect to the internet. The process is straightforward.

1. **Locate the Network Icon**: Find the network icon in the notification area on the far right of your taskbar. It may look like a globe 🌐 or a series of curved lines for Wi-Fi 📶.
    
2. **Open Quick Settings**: Click on the network icon. This will open the Quick Settings panel.
    
3. **Ensure Wi-Fi is On**: In the panel, make sure the Wi-Fi button is enabled (it will be highlighted, usually in blue). If it's off, click it to turn it on.
    
4. **View Available Networks**: Click the small arrow `>` next to the Wi-Fi button. Windows will display a list of all the Wi-Fi networks it can detect in your vicinity.
    
5. **Select Your Network**: Click on the name of the network you want to join (e.g., `Home-WiFi-5G` or `Khulna_University_WiFi`).
    
6. **Enter the Password**: If the network is secured (indicated by a lock symbol), you will be prompted to enter the network security key (the password). Type it carefully, as it is case-sensitive.
    
7. **Connect**: Click **Connect**. After a few moments, the status should change to "Connected, secured," and you will have internet access.
    

Windows will remember this network and automatically connect to it the next time you are in range.

#### Connecting to a Wired Network (Ethernet) 🖥️

For a faster and more stable connection, common for desktop PCs or in offices, you can use an Ethernet cable.

1. **Plug in the Cable**: Connect one end of the Ethernet cable to the Ethernet port on your computer (it looks like a large telephone jack) and the other end to your router or a network wall port.
    
2. **Automatic Connection**: In most cases, that's all you need to do. Windows will automatically detect the physical connection and establish internet access. The network icon on the taskbar will change to an icon of a small computer with a cable.

#### Connecting to Bluetooth Devices 🎧🖱️

Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology used to connect peripherals like mice, keyboards, headphones, and speakers without cables. The process of connecting a new device is called **pairing**.

1. **Make Your Device Discoverable**: Before Windows can find your device, you must put the device itself into "pairing mode." This process varies for each device, so check its user manual (it often involves pressing and holding a button until a light starts blinking).
    
2. **Open Bluetooth Settings**: Go to **Start Menu > Settings > Bluetooth & devices**.
    
3. **Turn Bluetooth On**: Ensure the main Bluetooth toggle switch at the top of the page is turned **On**.
    
4. **Add a New Device**: Click the large **"+ Add device"** button.
    
5. **Choose Connection Type**: A new window will appear. Select **Bluetooth**.
    
6. **Select Your Device**: Windows will begin scanning for nearby devices in pairing mode. When you see your device's name appear in the list, click on it.
    
7. **Pairing Complete**: The devices will pair, and your peripheral will be ready to use.
    

Once a device is paired, it will be remembered by your computer and should connect automatically whenever it is turned on and within range.
