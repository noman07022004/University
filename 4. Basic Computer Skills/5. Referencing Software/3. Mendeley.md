### 5.3 Mendeley ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: Mendeley is a very popular and widely used reference manager that cleverly combines a powerful PDF organizer with academic social networking features. Its free tier makes it highly accessible to students, and its intuitive interface for reading and annotating research papers is a significant workflow advantage.
> 
> **Why Not as Critical**: Mendeley is a commercial product owned by the publisher Elsevier, and its free version comes with a storage limit. Recent changes to its citation plugin have been met with mixed reviews, and some users prefer the open-source nature and unlimited local storage of Zotero.

**Mendeley** is a free reference manager and academic social network that helps you organize your research, collaborate with others online, and discover new articles. Its key strength lies in its excellent integration of library management with a robust PDF reader and annotator.

#### The Core Workflow in Mendeley

Mendeley offers several powerful ways to build and use your research library.

##### Step 1: Building Your Library

- **Web Importer**: Similar to other managers, you use the browser extension to save sources you find online directly to your library.
    
- **Drag and Drop**: You can simply drag and drop PDF files from your computer directly into the Mendeley desktop app. Mendeley will scan the document and attempt to automatically identify its title, authors, year, and other metadata.
    
- **Watch Folder**: A very useful feature where you can tell Mendeley to "watch" a specific folder on your computer. Any time you save a new PDF to that folder, Mendeley will automatically import it into your library.
    

##### Step 2: Organizing and Annotating PDFs

This is where Mendeley shines.

- **Collections**: You can create "Collections" (folders) to organize your references by topic or project.
    
- **Integrated PDF Reader**: When you double-click a reference that has a PDF, it opens in a new tab directly within the Mendeley application. You can highlight text, add sticky notes, and make annotations. All your annotations are saved and synced, so you can access them on any device.
    

##### Step 3: Citing in Microsoft Word

Mendeley Cite is a modern plugin that is typically accessed from the **References** tab in Word.

1. Place your cursor where a citation is needed.
    
2. Open the Mendeley Cite pane. It will show you a list of all the references in your library.
    
3. Search for the reference you need, tick the checkbox next to it, and click **"Insert Citation"**.
    
4. The citation style can be changed at any time from within this same pane.
    

##### Step 4: Generating the Bibliography

After inserting your citations, place your cursor at the end of your document, go to the Mendeley Cite pane, click the three dots for "More," and select **"Insert Bibliography"**. The bibliography will appear and will update automatically as you continue to work.

#### Unique Features of Mendeley

- **Academic Social Network**: You can create a profile, follow other researchers, and join public groups to discover new research in your field of interest.
    
- **Suggestions**: Based on the articles you add to your library, Mendeley's recommendation engine will suggest other related papers you might find interesting.
    
- **Freemium Model**: Mendeley provides a free account with 2 GB of cloud storage. For researchers with a very large collection of PDFs, this may require upgrading to a paid plan for more space.
