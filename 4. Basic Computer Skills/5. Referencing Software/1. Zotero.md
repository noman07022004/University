#### Setting Up Zotero: The Two Essential Parts

To use Zotero to its full potential, you must install **both** of these components:

1. **The Zotero Desktop App**: This is the main program that you install on your computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux). It is where your library of references and PDFs is stored and managed.
    
2. **The Zotero Connector**: This is a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge. This is the tool that lets you capture sources directly from the web.
    

Without the Connector, you would have to enter all your sources manually, defeating much of the purpose of the software.

#### The Zotero Workflow: A Step-by-Step Guide

Here is how you use Zotero in your academic work.

##### Step 1: Collect Sources with the Connector

Imagine you are browsing an online academic database (like Google Scholar, JSTOR, or your university's library portal) and you find a useful journal article.

- **Look for the Icon**: In your browser's toolbar, the Zotero Connector icon will change to reflect the type of content on the page. It might look like a small article üìÑ, a book üìò, or even a folder üìÅ if there are multiple sources on the page.
    
- **Click to Save**: Click this icon. Zotero will automatically parse the webpage, extract all the citation information (title, author, journal, year, volume, pages, DOI), and save it as a new item in your Zotero desktop library. If a free PDF is available, Zotero will download and attach it to the citation automatically.
    

##### Step 2: Organize Your Library in the App

The Zotero desktop app is your personal research library.

- **Collections**: Use the folder icon on the top-left to create "Collections," which function like folders. It is best practice to create a new collection for each course or project (e.g., "CSE 1251 - Term Paper").
    
- **Metadata**: When you click on an item in your library, its details (the metadata) appear in the right-hand pane. Here you can review and edit the information to ensure it's correct.
    
- **PDFs and Notes**: You can open and read attached PDFs directly within Zotero, and even highlight text and add notes.
    

##### Step 3: Cite While Writing in Microsoft Word

After installing Zotero, a new "Zotero" tab will appear in Word's ribbon.

1. Place your cursor in the document where you need a citation.
    
2. Click the **"Add/Edit Citation"** button in the Zotero tab.
    
3. The first time you do this in a document, Zotero will ask you to choose your citation style (e.g., **American Psychological Association 7th Edition (APA)**, **Modern Language Association (MLA)**, etc.).
    
4. A red search bar will appear. Start typing the author's name or a word from the title. Zotero will search your library.
    
5. Select the correct source from the search results and press **Enter**. Zotero will insert a perfectly formatted in-text citation, like `(Rahman, 2025)`.
    

##### Step 4: Generate Your Bibliography

This is the final, magical step.

1. Move your cursor to the end of your document where the reference list should go.
    
2. Click the **"Add/Edit Bibliography"** button in the Zotero tab.
    

Zotero will instantly generate a complete, alphabetized, and perfectly formatted bibliography containing all of the sources you cited in your document. If you later add or remove citations, the bibliography will update automatically.
