### 1.3 Size and Capacity ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: This topic covers the fundamental vocabulary used to describe and compare computers. Understanding the units of data storage (from bits and bytes to terabytes) is an essential, practical skill for everything from buying a new laptop to managing files and understanding internet speeds. It is a core concept that is guaranteed to be on any exam.
> 
> **Why Not as Critical**: While the concepts are vital, the focus is on understanding and applying a hierarchy of units. The complex physics of how data is physically stored on a drive or the electronics behind processing speed are beyond the scope of a basic course.

The terms "size" and "capacity" can refer to a computer's physical dimensions, but more importantly, they describe its data handling and storage capabilities.

### Physical Size

A computer's physical size is directly related to its type and the technology of its era. As discussed under "Types of Computers" (1.2), there is a vast range:

- **Room-Sized**: **Supercomputers** and **mainframes** occupy large cabinets or multiple racks, often requiring dedicated, climate-controlled rooms.
    
- **Desk-Sized**: **Desktop computers** and **workstations** are designed for use at a desk.
    
- **Portable**: **Laptops**, **tablets**, and **smartphones** are designed for mobility, showcasing the incredible trend of **miniaturization**—packing more power into smaller devices. 💻
    
- **Embedded**: **Embedded computers** are often microscopic, designed to be completely integrated and hidden within other products.

### Capacity: Measuring Data

In computing, capacity most often refers to how much data a device can store (**storage capacity**) or how much working space it has (**memory capacity**). This capacity is measured in units based on the **bit**.

#### Bit and Byte

- **Bit (Binary Digit)**: The most basic unit of data in computing. A bit can only have one of two values: **0** or **1**. Think of it as an electrical switch that is either OFF (0) or ON (1).
    
- **Byte**: A group of **8 bits**. A byte is the standard unit used to represent a single character, such as a letter ('A'), a number ('5'), or a symbol ('?'). For example, in the ASCII encoding system, the character 'A' is represented by the byte `01000001`.
    

#### The Hierarchy of Data Storage Units

Because a single byte doesn't represent much data, we use a system of prefixes to denote larger quantities. This is where a common point of confusion arises.

1. **The Manufacturer's System (Base-10, Decimal)**: Storage device manufacturers (like hard drive and SSD makers) market their products using a decimal (power of 10) system, where "kilo" means 1,000.
    
2. **The Operating System's System (Base-2, Binary)**: Computer operating systems (like Windows) and memory (RAM) manufacturers measure capacity using a binary (power of 2) system, where "kilo" means 1,024 (210).
    

This discrepancy is why a 1 Terabyte (TB) hard drive, which a manufacturer defines as 1 trillion bytes, is reported by Windows as approximately 931 Gigabytes (GB).

The standard units are as follows:

|Unit Name|Abbreviation|Base-10 (Decimal) Size|Base-2 (Binary) Size|Relatable Example|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Byte**|B|1 Byte|1 Byte|A single character.|
|**Kilobyte**|KB|1,000 bytes|1,024 bytes|A short email; a simple text file.|
|**Megabyte**|MB|1,000 KB|1,024 KB|A high-resolution photo; an MP3 song.|
|**Gigabyte**|GB|1,000 MB|1,024 MB|An HD movie; the RAM in a modern PC.|
|**Terabyte**|TB|1,000 GB|1,024 GB|The capacity of a modern hard drive.|
|**Petabyte**|PB|1,000 TB|1,024 TB|Data processed by Google servers daily.|

#### Other Forms of Capacity

Beyond storage, capacity can also refer to:

- **Processing Speed**: The speed of a CPU is measured in **Hertz (Hz)**, which is the number of processing cycles per second. Modern CPUs are measured in **Gigahertz (GHz)**, meaning billions of cycles per second. A 3.2 GHz processor can perform 3.2 billion cycles every second.
    
- **Network Speed (Bandwidth)**: A network's data transfer rate is measured in **bits per second (bps)**, not bytes. This is why a 100 **Megabit** per second (Mbps) internet connection will download a file at a maximum of about 12.5 **Megabytes** per second (MBps), because there are 8 bits in a byte (100 Mbps / 8 = 12.5 MBps).

**Important Note:** Always pay close attention to the capitalization:

- `MB` (megabyte) is used for storage and file size.
    
- `Mb` (megabit) is used for network speed. This distinction is crucial for understanding the difference between your storage capacity and your internet or data transfer speed.
