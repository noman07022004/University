### 1.10 Computer networks ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: In our hyper-connected world, understanding the basics of computer networks is no longer optional‚Äîit's essential. This knowledge is fundamental to using the internet, sharing files, and understanding concepts like Wi-Fi and cybersecurity. It explains the infrastructure that powers modern communication and information access.
> 
> **Why Not as Critical**: For this course, a high-level conceptual understanding of network types is sufficient. The deep technical details of network protocols (like TCP/IP), topologies, and hardware configuration are complex, specialized topics for network engineers.

A **computer network** is a set of computers and devices (like printers and servers) connected together for the purpose of sharing resources, exchanging files, and allowing electronic communications. The connections can be made using physical cables (wired) or through radio waves (wireless).

The primary purposes of creating a network are:

- **Resource Sharing**: To share hardware like printers and scanners, software licenses, and storage space.
    
- **Information Sharing**: To allow easy access to shared data and files from multiple computers.
    
- **Communication**: To facilitate communication via email, video conferencing, and instant messaging. üí¨

### Types of Networks by Geographical Area

Networks are most commonly classified by the geographical area they span.

#### LAN (Local Area Network)

A LAN connects devices within a limited and private area, such as a home, a single office building, or a university campus.

- **Scope**: Small, typically within one building.
    
- **Characteristics**: High data transfer speeds, privately owned and managed.
    
- **Technology**: Usually uses **Ethernet** cables for wired connections and **Wi-Fi** for wireless connections.
    
- **Example**: The network connecting all the computers, printers, and servers in your university's computer lab. Your home Wi-Fi network is also a LAN.
    

#### WAN (Wide Area Network)

A WAN connects computers over a large geographical area, which can include different cities, countries, or even continents.

- **Scope**: Large, can be global.
    
- **Characteristics**: Slower speeds than a LAN, typically uses public infrastructure like telephone lines, fiber optic cables, or satellite links.
    
- **Technology**: Relies on routers to connect disparate LANs.
    
- **Example**: The **Internet** is the largest WAN in the world. A bank connecting its branches in Dhaka, Khulna, and Chattogram would use a WAN.
    

#### MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)

A MAN is a network that is larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN, typically covering a city or a large town.

- **Scope**: A city or metropolitan area.
    
- **Characteristics**: Often used to connect multiple LANs of different organizations or to provide a city-wide internet connection.
    
- **Example**: A network provided by a cable TV company that spans an entire city.
    

#### PAN (Personal Area Network)

A PAN is a very small-scale network used for connecting devices within the immediate vicinity of an individual.

- **Scope**: A few meters.
    
- **Characteristics**: Used for communication among personal devices.
    
- **Technology**: The most common technology is **Bluetooth**.
    
- **Example**: Connecting your smartphone to wireless headphones, a wireless mouse to your laptop, or syncing your smartwatch with your phone. üéß

**Important Note:** It's common to confuse the **Internet** and the **World Wide Web (WWW)**, but they are not the same.

- The **Internet** is the massive, global hardware and software infrastructure‚Äîthe "network of networks"‚Äîthat connects millions of computers.
    
- The **World Wide Web** is a service that runs _on_ the Internet. It is the vast collection of interconnected documents (web pages) and other web resources that you access using a browser. üåê
