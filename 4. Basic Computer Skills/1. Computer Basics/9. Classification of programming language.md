## üìë 1.9 Computer Basics: Classification of Programming Language ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: Understanding programming language classification provides insight into how software is developed, which is foundational for students interested in coding or software applications. It‚Äôs relevant for academic tasks involving programming and connects to syllabus topics like software and development tools, making it likely to appear in exams.  
> **Why Not as Critical**: For students focused on practical ICT skills (e.g., using Microsoft Office), programming languages are less immediately applicable, though they are essential for technical courses or future software development.

### üìå Introduction

A **programming language** is a formal language used to write instructions that a computer can execute to perform specific tasks. Programming languages are classified based on their level of abstraction, purpose, and execution style, which determine their ease of use and application. This subtopic explores the main classifications of programming languages, their characteristics, and their relevance to academic and practical computing.

### üîë Key Classifications of Programming Languages

---

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Based on Level of Abstraction

- **Low-Level Programming Languages**:
  - Closer to machine code (binary), directly interacting with hardware.
  - **Characteristics**:
    - Difficult to write and understand.
    - Fast execution, highly efficient.
    - Hardware-specific, less portable across different systems.
  - **Types**:
    - **Machine Language**: Instructions in binary (0s and 1s), specific to a computer‚Äôs architecture.
      - Example: Instructions like `10110000` for a specific CPU operation.
    - **Assembly Language**: Uses mnemonic codes (e.g., `MOV`, `ADD`) instead of binary, translated to machine code by an assembler.
      - Example: `MOV AX, BX` to move data between registers.
  - **Relevance**: Rarely used by students but important for understanding computer fundamentals and hardware control.
  - **Examples**: Assembly for specific microprocessors (e.g., x86 assembly).

- **High-Level Programming Languages**:
  - Closer to human language, easier to write and understand.
  - **Characteristics**:
    - Portable across different systems (not hardware-specific).
    - Slower execution than low-level due to translation to machine code.
    - Requires compilers or interpreters to convert to machine code.
  - **Examples**:
    - **C**: General-purpose, used for system programming and applications.
    - **Python**: Easy to learn, used for scripting, data analysis, and academic projects.
    - **Java**: Platform-independent, used for web and mobile applications.
  - **Relevance**: Widely used by students for coding assignments, data analysis, and software development in academic settings.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Based on Execution Style

- **Compiled Languages**:
  - Code is translated into machine code by a compiler before execution, creating an executable file.
  - **Characteristics**:
    - Faster execution since code is pre-translated.
    - Requires compilation for each platform.
  - **Examples**:
    - **C++**: Used for performance-critical applications like games.
    - **Java**: Compiled to bytecode, runs on any Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
  - **Relevance**: Useful for students in programming courses requiring efficient applications.

- **Interpreted Languages**:
  - Code is executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime, without pre-compilation.
  - **Characteristics**:
    - Slower execution but easier to debug and modify.
    - Highly portable, no need for platform-specific compilation.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Python**: Interpreted, ideal for rapid development and academic projects.
    - **JavaScript**: Used for web development, runs in browsers.
  - **Relevance**: Popular for beginners and academic tasks like scripting or web programming.

- **Hybrid Languages**:
  - Combine compilation and interpretation (e.g., compiled to intermediate code, then interpreted).
  - **Example**: **Java** (compiled to bytecode, interpreted by JVM).
  - **Relevance**: Offers flexibility for cross-platform academic projects.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Based on Purpose

- **General-Purpose Languages**:
  - Versatile, used for a wide range of applications.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Python**: Data analysis, machine learning, web development.
    - **C#**: Desktop and web applications, games (e.g., Unity).
  - **Relevance**: Suitable for diverse academic tasks, from coding to research.

- **Domain-Specific Languages**:
  - Designed for specific applications or industries.
  - **Examples**:
    - **SQL**: For database management and queries.
    - **HTML/CSS**: For web design and structure.
    - **MATLAB**: For mathematical and scientific computations.
  - **Relevance**: Useful for specialized academic tasks like database management or scientific simulations.

---

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Based on Programming Paradigm

- **Procedural Languages**:
  - Focus on procedures or functions to perform tasks in a sequence.
  - **Examples**: **C**, **Pascal**.
  - **Relevance**: Teaches structured programming, useful for beginners.

- **Object-Oriented Languages**:
  - Organize code into objects with properties and methods, promoting reusability.
  - **Examples**: **Java**, **Python**, **C++**.
  - **Relevance**: Common in modern software development and academic projects.

- **Functional Languages**:
  - Emphasize functions without side effects, used in mathematical computations.
  - **Examples**: **Haskell**, **Lisp**.
  - **Relevance**: Less common but useful for advanced academic research.

- **Scripting Languages**:
  - Used for automating tasks or web development, often interpreted.
  - **Examples**: **Python**, **JavaScript**, **PHP**.
  - **Relevance**: Ideal for quick scripting tasks in academic settings.

### üìö Exam Tips

- **Memorize classifications**: Know the main categories (low-level vs. high-level, compiled vs. interpreted, etc.) with examples.  
- **Explain differences**: Be ready to compare characteristics (e.g., low-level vs. high-level for speed and ease of use).  
- **Link to syllabus**: Connect to software classification (programming languages as development software) and upcoming topics like computer networks (e.g., JavaScript for web applications).  
- **Use academic examples**: Relate to student tasks (e.g., Python for data analysis, SQL for database assignments).
