### 8.2 Publication and resources ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: University-level work must be supported by credible, authoritative, and evidence-based sources. A general web search is not sufficient. This subtopic teaches you how to find scholarly resources like peer-reviewed journal articles and academic books, which is the absolute foundation of proper academic research and essential for writing high-quality assignments.

While general searches are for everyday information, academic research requires you to find **scholarly publications and resources**. These are materials written by experts, for experts, that have been vetted for accuracy and quality, usually through a process called **peer review**.

## Google Scholar: The Academic Starting Point

The best place to begin your academic search is **Google Scholar** (`scholar.google.com`). It's a specialized search engine that filters out the noise of the general web and indexes only scholarly literature.

### How to Interpret Google Scholar Results

A Google Scholar search results page gives you much more information than a regular Google search:

- **[PDF] Links**: Look to the right of the search results. If you see a link that says `[PDF]`, it will often take you directly to a free, full-text version of the article.
    
- **"Cited by"**: This is a crucial feature. It shows you the number of other scholarly articles that have cited this particular work. A high "Cited by" number is a good indicator that the paper is influential and important in its field.
    
- **"Cite" Button** (`"`): Clicking this button brings up a window with pre-formatted citations in several major styles (APA, MLA, etc.). This is a quick way to get the citation information for your reference manager like Zotero.
    
- **"Related articles"**: This is an excellent tool for discovery. If you find one perfect article, clicking "Related articles" will show you other papers that are very similar in topic.

## University Library Databases: The Gold Standard

While Google Scholar is a great starting point, the most powerful tool for a university student is the collection of **academic databases** subscribed to by your university library.

### What Are They?

These are massive, curated online libraries containing millions of full-text journal articles, e-books, and conference proceedings. Your university pays subscription fees so that you, as a student, can access this premium content for free.

### Why Are They Better?

- **Guaranteed Quality**: The content in these databases is almost entirely peer-reviewed and published by reputable academic publishers.
    
- **Full-Text Access**: They provide access to countless articles that are behind a "paywall" on the open internet.
    
- **Advanced Search**: They have powerful, subject-specific search filters that allow you to narrow your results by date, subject area, methodology, and more.
    

### How to Access Them

1. Navigate to your university library's official website (for example, the Khulna University Central Library webpage).
    
2. Look for a section called **"E-Resources," "Databases,"** or **"Online Journals."**
    
3. You will likely be asked to **log in with your student ID and password**. This authenticates you as a member of the university and grants you access.
    
4. Choose a relevant database. Some major ones include:
    
    - **JSTOR**: Excellent for arts, humanities, and social sciences.
        
    - **Scopus** and **Web of Science**: Huge, multi-disciplinary databases.
        
    - **IEEE Xplore**: The essential database for engineering and computer science.
        
    - **PubMed**: The primary resource for medicine and life sciences.
