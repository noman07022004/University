## 8. Use of Search Engines ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: The ability to efficiently find relevant and reliable information online is a fundamental skill for modern life and a superpower for academic research. Search engines are the primary gateway to the world's information. Mastering advanced search techniques transforms this tool from a simple dictionary into a precision instrument for learning, problem-solving, and discovering high-quality academic sources.

A **search engine** (like Google, Bing, or DuckDuckGo) is a complex software system that indexes the vast content of the World Wide Web, allowing you to find information by typing in keywords or phrases. However, the true skill is not just finding information, but finding the _right_ information efficiently. This involves two levels of mastery: refining your general searches and knowing how to conduct specialized academic searches.

### Mastering General Searches: Beyond Simple Keywords

Anyone can type a few words into Google. A power user employs specific operators to force the search engine to return much more precise results.

- **Use Quotes (`" "`) for Exact Phrases**: If you search for an exact phrase, enclose it in double quotes. This is the most useful search trick.
    
    - `causes of river erosion` → Returns pages with those words anywhere on the page.
        
    - `"causes of river erosion"` → Returns only pages where that exact phrase appears.
        
- **Use a Hyphen (`-`) to Exclude Words**: Place a hyphen directly before a word you want to exclude to narrow your results.
    
    - `Sundarbans ecosystem` → Might include results about tourism.
        
    - `Sundarbans ecosystem -tourism` → Removes pages that mention tourism, focusing more on scientific results.
        
- **Use `site:` to Search a Specific Website**: This is incredibly powerful for finding information from a trusted source.
    
    - `scholarship site:ku.ac.bd` → Searches for the word "scholarship" only within the Khulna University website.
        
    - `environmental policy site:gov.bd` → Searches for environmental policy only on official Bangladesh government websites.
        
- **Use `filetype:` to Find Specific File Types**: This is excellent for finding documents, presentations, or data.
    
    - `"financial statement 2024" filetype:pdf` → Finds financial statements only in PDF format.
        
    - `lecture on programming filetype:ppt` → Finds PowerPoint presentations on programming.

### Finding Academic Publications and Resources

While Google is useful, it is often not suitable for university-level research because it mixes reliable sources with blogs, opinion pieces, and commercial websites. For your assignments, you need scholarly, peer-reviewed sources.

#### Google Scholar (`scholar.google.com`)

This is your first step up from a regular Google search. Google Scholar is a special search engine that only indexes scholarly literature like journal articles, conference papers, theses, and books.

Key features include:

- **"Cited by"**: Shows you how many other academic papers have cited that source, indicating its importance in the field.
    
- **Related articles**: Suggests other similar research papers.
    
- **Cite Button (`"`)**: Provides pre-formatted citations in various styles (like APA, MLA) that you can copy.
    
- **Full-Text Links**: Often provides direct links to a full-text PDF of the article if it is available for free.
    

#### University Library Databases (The Gold Standard)

Your university library pays for subscriptions to powerful academic databases that contain millions of high-quality, peer-reviewed articles not freely available on the internet. These are the best sources for your research.

- **Examples**: Common databases include **JSTOR**, **Scopus**, **Web of Science**, **IEEE Xplore** (for engineering), and **PubMed** (for biomedical sciences).
    
- **Access**: You typically access these databases through your university library's website. You will likely need to log in with your student ID and password to prove you are an authorized user.
    

#### Evaluating Your Sources

Once you find a source, you must evaluate its credibility. A simple method is the **CRAAP Test**:

- **C**urrency: When was it published? Is it up-to-date for your topic?
    
- **R**elevance: How well does it answer your research question?
    
- **A**uthority: Who is the author? What are their credentials? Who is the publisher?
    
- **A**ccuracy: Is the information supported by evidence and citations? Is it peer-reviewed?
    
- **P**urpose: Why was this created? Is it objective research, or is it trying to sell something or push an opinion?
