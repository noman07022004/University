Of course. Let's do a detailed dive into the skill of performing general searches.

### 8.1 General Searches ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: The ability to conduct a fast and effective general search is a foundational skill in the digital age. It is the primary method for answering everyday questions, learning new things, and conducting preliminary research on any topic. Mastering these techniques will save you a significant amount of time and dramatically improve the quality and relevance of the information you find.

**General searches** are searches performed on standard search engines like Google or Bing to find information on the public web. The goal is to move from a vague question to a precise query that provides accurate, relevant results on the first try.

#### The Art of Choosing Keywords

The quality of your search results is directly related to the quality of your search query.

- **Be Specific**: The single most important rule is to be as specific as possible. The search engine is a computer; it doesn't understand context the way a human does.
    
    - **Weak search**: `university courses`
        
    - **Strong search**: `urban planning undergraduate courses in Bangladesh`
        
- **Think Like the Webpage**: Ask yourself: "What words would be on the page I'm looking for?" A website is more likely to use formal or technical terms.
    
    - **Weak search**: `my laptop screen went black`
        
    - **Strong search**: `laptop black screen fix Windows 11`

#### Power Tools for Precision: Advanced Search Operators

To move from a basic user to a power user, you must use search operators. These are special symbols and commands that control your search results.

- ### Use Quotes (`" "`) for an Exact Phrase
    
    This forces the search engine to find the words in that exact order. It is the most powerful and frequently used operator.
    
    - **Example**: Searching for `"Padma Multipurpose Bridge"` will give you results specifically about the bridge, while a search without quotes might return pages that simply have the words "padma" and "bridge" somewhere on them.
        
- ### Use a Hyphen (`-`) to Exclude a Word
    
    This narrows your search by removing results containing a specific word.
    
    - **Example**: If you are searching for the Sundari tree, a search for `Sundari tree` might return results about beauty products. A better search would be `Sundari tree -beauty`.
        
- ### Use `site:` to Search Within a Specific Website
    
    This is extremely useful when you know you want information from a trusted source.
    
    - **Example**: To find information about the library on the Khulna University website, you would search: `library hours site:ku.ac.bd`
        
- ### Use `filetype:` to Find Specific Kinds of Files
    
    This is perfect when you are looking for a specific type of document.
    
    - **Example**: To find a course syllabus, which is often a PDF, you could search: `"CSE 1251" syllabus filetype:pdf`
        
- ### Use `OR` to Find One of Several Terms
    
    This broadens your search to include results that have either of your specified keywords. The `OR` must be in uppercase.
    
    - **Example**: `(boat OR ship) building in Khulna` will find pages that mention either "boat building" or "ship building."

#### Using the Search Engine's Built-in Tools

Don't forget the tools that are right in front of you on the search results page.

- **Search Tabs**: Below the search bar, you have tabs for **Images**, **News**, **Videos**, **Maps**, etc. If you need a picture of something, clicking the "Images" tab is much faster than doing a web search.
    
- **The "Tools" Button**: After you search, a "Tools" button appears on the right. Clicking it gives you powerful filters:
    
    - **Filter by Time**: You can filter results to show only those from the "Past hour," "Past 24 hours," or "Past year." This is essential for finding the most current information on a topic.
        
    - **Filter by Verbatim**: By default, Google may search for synonyms of your words. Selecting "Verbatim" forces it to search for your exact words only.
