### 9.7 Scanning applications ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: In your academic life, you will constantly need to bridge the gap between physical and digital documents. Scanning applications transform your smartphone into a high-quality portable scanner, allowing you to digitize handwritten notes, signed forms, or pages from a library book with ease. This is an essential skill for creating clean, professional, and readable digital documents.
> 
> **Why Not as Critical**: While incredibly useful, this is a supplementary skill. A student can get by in many situations by simply taking a photo, although the result will be far less professional and harder to read than a proper scan.

A **scanning application** is a program on your smartphone that uses its camera to capture an image of a physical document and then intelligently processes it to create a high-quality, clean digital file (usually a PDF).

### Why Use a Scanning App Instead of Your Camera?

A scanning app is far superior to just taking a photo because it includes several key features:

- **Automatic Edge Detection**: The app's software intelligently finds the four corners of your document, automatically cropping out the desk or background behind it.
    
- **Perspective Correction**: If you capture the document from a slight angle, the app will automatically correct the perspective, making the final image look like a perfectly flat, top-down scan.
    
- **Image Enhancement**: The app automatically enhances the image to improve readability. It increases the contrast, brightens the whites, and sharpens the text, often providing modes like "Black & White" or "Whiteboard."
    
- **Multi-Page PDFs**: This is a crucial feature. You can scan multiple pages in a row and save them all as a **single, multi-page PDF document**. This is perfect for submitting a multi-page assignment.
    
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Many advanced scanning apps can "read" the text in the scanned image and convert it into actual, selectable text that you can copy and paste.

### The Scanning Workflow

The process is simple and similar across most apps:

1. **Prepare**: Place your document on a flat surface with good lighting and a background that contrasts with the paper.
    
2. **Capture**: Open the app and point your phone's camera at the document. The app will usually highlight the document's edges automatically. Hold steady and capture the image.
    
3. **Review and Adjust**: The app will show you the cropped and enhanced scan. You can manually adjust the crop corners if needed.
    
4. **Add More Pages**: If you have more pages, use the "add page" or multi-scan feature to continue capturing.
    
5. **Save and Share**: Once you're done, you can save the entire set of captures as a single PDF. The app will then give you options to share the file via email or, **most usefully, upload it directly to your cloud storage** (like Google Drive or OneDrive).
