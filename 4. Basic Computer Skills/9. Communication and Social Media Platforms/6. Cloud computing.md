Of course. Let's cover the topic of cloud computing.

### 9.6 Cloud computing ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: Cloud computing is the foundational technology behind modern data access, collaboration, and backup. For students, understanding and using cloud storage services like Google Drive or OneDrive is an essential skill for group projects, accessing files from any device, and protecting their valuable academic work from being lost.
> 
> **Why Not as Critical**: Impossible to justify. This is a fundamental concept of modern computing and a critical practical skill.

**Cloud computing** is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, and software—over the Internet ("the cloud"). In simple terms, instead of keeping all your files and programs on your personal computer's hard drive, you use a network of remote servers to store and manage your data. The "cloud" is simply a metaphor for the Internet.

### The Most Important Service for Students: Cloud Storage ☁️

For your academic work, the most important application of cloud computing is **cloud storage**. This is a service that lets you save your files in a secure, remote location and access them from any device with an internet connection.

The two main providers you will likely use are:

- **Google Drive** (if your university uses Google Workspace)
    
- **Microsoft OneDrive** (if your university uses Microsoft 365)
    

Using cloud storage provides three transformative benefits for students:

#### 1. Accessibility and Synchronization

You are no longer tied to a single computer. You can start writing an assignment on a university lab computer, save it to your Google Drive or OneDrive, and then continue working on it from your laptop at home. Your files are always available and in sync. Many services offer a desktop app that creates a special folder on your PC that automatically syncs with the cloud.

#### 2. Backup and Security

Storing your thesis or final report _only_ on your laptop's hard drive or a single USB stick is extremely risky. If that device is lost, stolen, or damaged, your work is gone forever. Cloud storage acts as a vital backup. Because your files are stored on the secure servers of major tech companies, they are safe from hardware failure.

#### 3. Collaboration and Sharing

This is the feature that revolutionizes group projects.

- **Sharing**: You can share a single file or an entire folder with your group members simply by sending them a link. You can control their permissions, allowing them to be a "Viewer" (can only look), "Commenter" (can suggest edits), or "Editor" (can make direct changes).
    
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: This is the most powerful feature. When you use cloud-based applications like **Google Docs** or **Microsoft Word Online**, multiple people can open and edit the **exact same file at the same time**. You can see your partners' cursors moving and their changes appearing as they type. This eliminates the chaos of emailing multiple different versions of a document back and forth.

### You Are Already Using the Cloud

You may not realize it, but many of the services you use daily are cloud applications.

- **Email (Gmail/Outlook)**: Your emails are not stored on your computer; they are stored in the cloud.
    
- **Google Classroom**: The entire VLMS operates in the cloud.
    
- **Referencing Software (Zotero/Mendeley)**: When you sync your library, you are using the cloud to keep it consistent across your devices.
