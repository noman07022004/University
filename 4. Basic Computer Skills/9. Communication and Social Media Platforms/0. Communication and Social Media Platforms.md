## 9. Communication and Social Media Platforms ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: These platforms are the fundamental infrastructure for modern communication, collaboration, and data management. In a university setting, your ability to professionally manage email, participate in virtual meetings, and collaborate on documents using cloud services is not just a useful skill‚Äîit is an absolute requirement for your academic workflow.

This topic covers the diverse ecosystem of digital tools that allow us to connect, share, and work together. These platforms can be grouped by their primary function: formal communication (email), real-time meetings (video conferencing), community interaction (social media), and the data management that underpins it all (cloud computing and scanning).

### Asynchronous Communication: Professional Correspondence with Email

**Email services** (like Gmail and Outlook) are the primary tool for formal and semi-formal communication in academia. Email is **asynchronous**, meaning messages are sent and can be read at any time, not requiring an instant response.

- **Your Institutional Email**: The single most important communication tool you have is your **institutional email** (e.g., `your-id@ku.ac.bd`). This is the official channel for all communication from your instructors, the university administration, and the library. You must check it daily. **Setting it up** on your phone and computer is a top priority.
    
- **Email Etiquette**: When emailing a professor or university staff, you must be professional:
    
    - **Subject**: Use a clear and specific subject line (e.g., "Question about Assignment 2 - CSE 1251").
        
    - **Salutation**: Use a formal greeting (e.g., "Dear Professor Rahman,").
        
    - **Body**: Be concise, clear, and use proper grammar and spelling.
        
    - **Closing**: End with a professional closing and your full name and student ID.

### Synchronous Communication: Virtual Meetings

Platforms like **Zoom** and **Google Meet** are for **synchronous** (real-time) communication. They are the standard for online classes, virtual office hours, and group project meetings.

- **Core Features**: The essential features of both platforms include video and audio controls, **screen sharing** (which is critical for giving presentations), a text-based **chat**, and the ability to record meetings.
    
- **Meeting Etiquette**:
    
    - **Mute Yourself**: Mute your microphone when you are not speaking to eliminate background noise.
        
    - **Be Mindful of Your Background**: Choose a simple, non-distracting background.
        
    - **Participate Respectfully**: Use the "raise hand" feature to ask questions without interrupting.

### Social Networking: Informal Community Platforms

A platform like **Facebook** is a social network designed for connecting with friends and communities. While not a formal academic tool, it is often used by students to create informal class groups. These groups can be useful for asking questions among peers, sharing reminders, and organizing study sessions. Remember to manage your **privacy settings** and maintain a respectable online presence.

### Data Management: The Backbone of Collaboration

Effective communication relies on the ability to easily access and share information. This is powered by cloud computing and digitalization tools.

- #### Cloud Computing ‚òÅÔ∏è
    
    **Cloud computing** means storing and accessing your files and applications over the internet instead of just on your computer's hard drive. For students, the most important application is **cloud storage**.
    
    - **Services**: The most common are **Google Drive** and **Microsoft OneDrive**. Your institutional email often comes with a generous amount of storage on one of these platforms.
        
    - **Key Benefits**:
        
        1. **Accessibility**: You can access your files from any device, anywhere you have internet.
            
        2. **Collaboration**: You can share a file with your group members, and everyone can edit the _same single version_ of the document in real-time. This is the best way to work on group projects.
            
        3. **Backup**: It serves as a secure backup for your important academic work. If your laptop is lost or damaged, your files are safe in the cloud.
            
- #### Scanning Applications üì±
    
    **Scanning applications** (like Microsoft Lens or Adobe Scan) use your smartphone's camera to turn physical documents into high-quality digital files (usually PDFs).
    
    - **The Workflow**: You simply take a picture of a book page, your handwritten notes, or a signed form. The app automatically crops the image, enhances its readability, and converts it into a clean PDF.
        
    - **Integration**: These apps are most powerful when connected to your cloud storage. You can scan a document and save it directly to your Google Drive or OneDrive, making it instantly available to attach to an email or submit to Google Classroom.
