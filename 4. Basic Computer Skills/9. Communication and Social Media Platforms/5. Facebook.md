Of course. Let's cover the next subtopic, Facebook.

### 9.5 Facebook ⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: As the world's largest social network, Facebook is a major platform for community building. In a university context, students frequently use it to create informal class groups for peer-to-peer support, resource sharing, and quick communication. Understanding how to use these groups and manage your digital privacy is a relevant modern skill.
> 
> **Why Not as Critical**: Facebook is **not** a formal academic tool. Official communication with instructors, submitting assignments, and receiving grades will **never** take place on this platform. Its use is supplementary, optional, and it can be a significant source of distraction from your studies.

**Facebook** is a social networking service that allows users to create a personal profile, connect with friends, and join groups. While its primary purpose is social, it has found a niche in the informal, community-based side of university life.

### The Primary Use Case for Students: Facebook Groups

The most relevant feature of Facebook for your studies is **Facebook Groups**. Students often create a private group for their specific class or batch (e.g., "Khulna University CSE Batch of 2025").

These informal groups can be very useful for:

- **Peer-to-Peer Support**: Asking classmates a quick question about a lecture you didn't understand or clarifying a minor point about an assignment.
    
- **Resource Sharing**: Sharing helpful links, study guides, or publicly available notes.
    
- **Quick Announcements**: Spreading informal reminders about class schedule changes or assignment deadlines.
    
- **Finding Group Members**: A common place to find partners for group projects.
    

**Best Practice**: While helpful, always verify critical information (like deadlines) with the official course VLMS (Google Classroom) or your instructor. Information in an unofficial Facebook group can sometimes be inaccurate.

### Managing Your Privacy and Professional Presence

Your social media profile is a part of your public identity. It's important to manage it professionally.

- **Your Profile is a Public Resume**: Be aware that professors, university staff, and future employers may see what you post publicly. Your online persona can impact your real-world reputation. **Think before you post**: "Would I be comfortable with an employer seeing this?"
    
- **Use the Privacy Checkup Tool**: Facebook has a built-in tool called **Privacy Checkup** that guides you through your most important privacy settings. You should use it to control:
    
    - **Who can see your posts**: It is highly recommended to set the default audience for your posts to **"Friends"** instead of **"Public."**
        
    - **Who can find you**: Manage who can send you friend requests.
        
    - **Your tagged photos**: You can enable a setting that requires you to approve any photo you are tagged in before it appears on your profile.

### Formal vs. Informal Communication: A Critical Distinction

It is essential to understand the correct channel for communication.

- **Formal / Official Communication**:
    
    - **Tool**: Your **Institutional Email** and the official **VLMS (Google Classroom)**.
        
    - **Use For**: Contacting instructors, submitting assignments, asking official questions, and receiving grades.
        
- **Informal / Unofficial Communication**:
    
    - **Tool**: **Facebook Groups** and **Messenger**.
        
    - **Use For**: Quick questions to classmates, social coordination, and sharing informal notes.
        

**The Golden Rule**: **Never** use Facebook Messenger to contact an instructor about an academic matter unless they have explicitly told you it is acceptable. The default and correct method is always their official university email.
