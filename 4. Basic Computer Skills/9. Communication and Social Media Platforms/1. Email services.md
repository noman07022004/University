### The Anatomy of a Professional Email

Understanding the components of an email is the first step to using it correctly.

- **To, Cc, and Bcc**:
    
    - **To**: The primary recipients of your message.
        
    - **Cc (Carbon Copy)**: Use this to include people who need to be aware of the message but are not expected to reply. All recipients can see the Cc list.
        
    - **Bcc (Blind Carbon Copy)**: Use this to include people without any of the other recipients knowing. This is useful for protecting privacy when sending a message to a large group.
        
- **Subject**: This is the single most important part of your email. It should be a clear, concise summary of the email's content.
    
    - **Bad Subject**: `Question`, `Hi`, `Urgent!!`
        
    - **Good Subject**: `CSE 1251 - Question About Assignment 3 Due Date`
        
- **Body**: The main message. It should be well-structured with a salutation, the body of the message, and a closing.
    
- **Attachments**: Use the paperclip icon üìé to attach files like documents or images. It is good practice to mention your attachment in the body of the email (e.g., "I have attached my report for your review.").
    
- **Signature**: This is a pre-configured block of text that is automatically added to the end of your emails. A professional signature should include your full name, student ID, and department/university.

- **‚úÖ DO use a professional closing.** End with "Sincerely," "Best regards," or "Thank you," followed by your full name and student ID.
    
- **‚ùå DON'T expect an instant reply.** Allow at least 24-48 business hours for a response.
    
- **‚ùå DON'T use slang, emojis, or informal language.** Keep the tone professional.

### Managing Your Inbox

A university email account can get very busy. Good management is key.

- **Check it Daily**: Make it a habit to check your institutional email at least once a day for important announcements.
    
- **Organize with Folders/Labels**: Create folders (in Outlook) or labels (in Gmail) for each of your courses to keep your messages organized.
    
- **Archive, Don't Delete**: When you are finished with an email, **Archive** it. This removes it from your inbox to keep things clean but saves it in a searchable folder in case you need it later.
    
- **Use the Search Bar**: The search function is the fastest way to find a specific email from the past.
