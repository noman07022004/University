### 9.2 Institutional email service setup ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: Your institutional email is your official digital identity at the university. All critical communications—from your instructors, the administration, and the library—will be sent to this address. Setting it up correctly on your phone and computer is a mandatory first step to ensure you never miss an important announcement or deadline.

An **institutional email** is an email account provided to you by your university, such as `your-student-id@ku.ac.bd`. This is more than just an email address; it is your key to accessing many university resources. Here is a general guide to setting it up.

### Step 1: First-Time Login and Activation

Before you can set up your email on your phone, you must first activate your account through a web browser.

1. **Find Your Credentials**: Your university's IT or admissions department will provide you with your official email address and a temporary password.
    
2. **Locate the Web Portal**: Find the official student email login page. You can usually find this by searching for "Khulna University student email login" or by looking in the student section of the university's main website. Most universities use either Google (Gmail) or Microsoft (Outlook) as their backend.
    
3. **Log In**: Use the credentials you were given to log in through the web portal.
    
4. **Change Your Password**: You will almost always be required to immediately change your temporary password to a new, secure password that only you know. This is a critical security step.
    
5. **Set Up Security**: You may also be prompted to set up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for added account security.

6. Enter the new, permanent password you created in Step 1.
    
7. Follow any on-screen prompts. Your university email will now appear as an account you can switch to within the Gmail app.
    

#### If your university uses Microsoft 365 (Outlook):

1. Download and open the official **Microsoft Outlook** app.
    
2. Enter your full institutional email address and tap **"Add Account."**

### Step 3: What to Do If You Have Trouble

If you encounter any problems, do not get frustrated. The best and most reliable source for help is your university's own support system.

- **Look for Official Guides**: Search your university's website for an "email setup guide" or "IT help" page. They will have detailed, specific instructions for their system.
    
- **Contact the IT Help Desk**: Your university has an Information Technology (IT) department with a help desk specifically to assist students with these kinds of issues. They can provide you with the correct server settings and walk you through the process.
