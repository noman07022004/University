Of course. Let's cover the video conferencing platform, Zoom.

### 9.3 Zoom ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: Zoom is a globally popular video conferencing platform, widely used by universities for online classes, webinars, and virtual office hours. Understanding how to use its core features and follow proper meeting etiquette is essential for effective participation in remote and hybrid learning environments.
> 
> **Why Not as Critical**: The basic functions of Zoom are quite intuitive, and the core skills (muting, sharing your screen) are directly transferable to other platforms like Google Meet. You only need to master the platform that your specific courses use.

**Zoom** is a video conferencing application that allows you to participate in virtual meetings with audio, video, and text chat. For students, it serves as a virtual classroom, enabling real-time interaction with instructors and classmates.

### Joining a Meeting

You can join a Zoom session in two main ways:

1. **Meeting Link**: This is the most common method. Your instructor will share a web link (URL). Simply clicking this link will open the Zoom app and take you directly into the meeting.
    
2. **Meeting ID & Passcode**: Alternatively, you may receive a Meeting ID (a 9-11 digit number) and a Passcode. To join this way, open the Zoom application, click the "Join" button, and enter the provided details.
    

**Pro-Tip**: For the best and most stable experience, it's highly recommended to download and use the **Zoom desktop client** rather than joining through your web browser.

### The In-Meeting Control Bar

Once you're in a meeting, your main controls are on a bar that typically appears at the bottom of the screen.

- **Mute / Unmute** üé§: This is the most important control. The #1 rule of video call etiquette is to **keep your microphone muted** whenever you are not speaking. This prevents your background noise from disrupting the class.
    
- **Start / Stop Video** üìπ: This turns your webcam on and off. Follow your instructor's guidance on whether video is required, but it is good practice to have it on during smaller, interactive meetings.
    
- **Participants**: Clicking this opens a panel showing everyone in the meeting. This panel is also where you will find the **Raise Hand** feature, which is the polite way to signal that you have a question.
    
- **Chat** üí¨: This opens a text chat window. It's useful for asking questions without interrupting the speaker, sharing links, or communicating if your microphone is not working. You can send messages to "Everyone" or privately to a specific person.
    
- **Share Screen**: This is an essential tool for giving presentations. It allows you to broadcast your computer screen to all other participants. You can choose to share your entire desktop or, more safely, a single application window (like just your PowerPoint presentation).
    
- **Reactions**: This allows you to provide non-verbal feedback, like a thumbs-up üëç or clapping hands üëè, without interrupting the flow of the meeting.
    
- **Leave**: The red button on the far right is used to exit the meeting.

### Best Practices for Students

- **Be Prepared**: Log in a few minutes early to make sure your audio and video are working correctly.
    
- **Choose Your Location Wisely**: Sit in a quiet, well-lit area with a simple, non-distracting background behind you.
    
- **Stay Focused**: Close any unnecessary tabs and applications to minimize distractions and stay engaged in the class.
    
- **Look at the Camera**: When you are speaking, try to look directly at your webcam, not at the image of yourself on the screen. This creates a better sense of eye contact.
