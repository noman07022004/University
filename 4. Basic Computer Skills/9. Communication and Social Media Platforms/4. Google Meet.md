Of course. Let's cover Google Meet.

### 9.4 Google Meet ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: As Google's native video conferencing platform, Google Meet is deeply integrated into the Google Workspace ecosystem. For universities that use Google Classroom and Calendar, Meet is the default and most seamless tool for online lectures and virtual meetings. Understanding its features is essential for participating in this integrated learning environment.
> 
> **Why Not as Critical**: The core skills of using Google Meet (muting, sharing your screen, etc.) are nearly identical to those for Zoom. A student who is proficient in one can quickly adapt to the other.

**Google Meet** is Google's secure and integrated video conferencing platform. It is designed to work seamlessly within a web browser (especially Google Chrome) and is the primary tool for real-time communication in institutions that use Google Workspace for Education.

### Joining a Meeting

Joining a Google Meet session is very straightforward, thanks to its integration with other Google services.

1. **Meet Link**: The most common way is by clicking a meeting link, which looks like `meet.google.com/xxx-yyyy-zzz`.
    
2. **Google Calendar**: If a class or meeting is scheduled in your Google Calendar, the event will have a **"Join with Google Meet"** button. This is a very common and convenient way to join.
    
3. **Google Classroom**: Your instructor may post a permanent Meet link for the course at the top of the Stream or Classwork page.

### The In-Meeting Control Bar

Your controls for the meeting are located in a bar at the bottom of the screen.

- **Mute / Unmute** 🎤: The microphone icon. Just like in Zoom, the most important rule of etiquette is to **keep your microphone muted** unless you are speaking.
    
- **Turn camera on / off** 📹: The camera icon. This controls your webcam. Meet also offers features like background blur and virtual backgrounds.
    
- **Captions (CC)**: Clicking this button enables live, automatically generated captions of the conversation. This is an excellent feature for accessibility or if you are in a noisy environment.
    
- **Raise hand** 👋: This places a small hand icon next to your name, politely signaling to the host that you would like to speak.
    
- **Present now** 💻: This is Google's term for screen sharing. It allows you to show your screen to others. You can choose to present your entire screen, a single application window, or just one browser tab (which is a great option for sharing video with audio).
    
- **In-call messages** 💬: The chat icon opens the text chat panel for sending messages to everyone in the meeting.
    
- **Leave call** 📞: The red phone icon is used to exit the meeting.

### Best Practices for Students

The etiquette for Google Meet is the same as for any professional video call.

- **Use Your Institutional Account**: Join meetings using your official university Google account so that your name is displayed correctly.
    
- **Be Prepared**: Join the call a minute or two early to ensure your microphone and camera are working.
    
- **Choose a Professional Setting**: Sit in a quiet, well-lit area with a simple background.
    
- **Stay Engaged**: Close unnecessary tabs and focus on the meeting, just as you would in a physical classroom.
