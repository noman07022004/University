Of course. Let's cover the next main topic on Virtual Learning Management Systems.

## 7. Use of Virtual Learning Management Systems ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: The Virtual Learning Management System (VLMS) is the central digital hub for your university courses. It is the primary platform where you will access lecture notes, find readings, submit your assignments, and receive your grades. Proficiency in using your university's VLMS is not an optional skill‚Äîit is absolutely essential for your day-to-day life as a student.

A **Virtual Learning Management System (VLMS)**, often called an LMS, is a web-based platform that allows instructors to manage and deliver course content online. Think of it as the official digital classroom for each of your courses. While universities use various systems like Moodle or Canvas, a very common and user-friendly example is **Google Classroom**, which perfectly illustrates how a VLMS works.

### Getting Started with Google Classroom

Accessing and joining your classes is the first step.

- **Access**: Google Classroom is a web service accessed at `classroom.google.com`. You will need a Google account to log in. It is critical that you use your **official university institutional email address** (e.g., `your-student-id@ku.ac.bd`), as this is the account your instructors will use to invite you.
    
- **Joining a Class**: There are two ways to join:
    
    1. **Invitation**: Your instructor will send an invitation to your university email. You simply open the email and click "Join."
        
    2. **Class Code**: Your instructor will provide a unique 6- or 7-character code. In Google Classroom, you click the `+` icon in the top-right corner, select "Join class," and enter the code.

### Navigating Your Digital Classroom

Once inside a class, the interface is typically organized into three main tabs.

#### 1. The Stream Tab

The **Stream** is the announcement board for the class. It is organized chronologically, with the newest posts at the top. This is where your instructor will post:

- Announcements and reminders.
    
- Welcome messages.
    
- Quick discussion questions.
    

It's a good place to check for the latest updates, but it is not where you will find your organized course materials.

#### 2. The Classwork Tab (The Most Important Tab)

The **Classwork** tab is the heart of your course. This is the organized, structured library of everything you need for your studies. Instructors typically organize this page using **Topics** to create sections like "Lecture Notes," "Weekly Readings," and "Assignments."

You will find several types of posts here, each with a different icon:

- **Material** üìñ: This is content for you to view or read. It can include lecture slides (PowerPoints, Google Slides), PDF articles, or links to websites and videos.
    
- **Assignment** üìù: This is a task that you must complete and submit, usually by a specific deadline. It will be graded.
    
- **Quiz Assignment**: A special type of assignment that uses a Google Form to create a quiz.
    
- **Question**: A short prompt from the instructor to generate class discussion.
    

#### 3. The People Tab

This tab is a simple directory that lists the name of your instructor(s) and the names of all the other students enrolled in the class.

### The Student Workflow: Submitting Assignments

Knowing how to properly submit your work through the VLMS is critical.

1. **Open the Assignment**: From the **Classwork** tab, click on the assignment you need to complete. This will open a detailed view with instructions, attached files, the due date, and the point value.
    
2. **Add or Create Your Work**: On the right side of the page, you will see a box labeled "Your work." Here you have several options:
    
    - **Add**: You can upload a file from your computer (like a finished Microsoft Word document) or a file from your Google Drive.
        
    - **Create**: You can create a new Google Doc, Slide, or Sheet directly from this window. This is often the best option, as the file is automatically named and attached to the assignment.
        
3. **Turn In Your Work**: This is the most crucial step. After you have attached or created your file, you **must click the "Turn In" or "Mark as Done" button**. If you do not click this button, your instructor will see the assignment as "Missing," even if you have uploaded a file.
    
4. **Check Grades and Feedback**: Once your instructor has graded your submission, you will be notified. You can return to the assignment page to see your grade and any private comments or feedback your instructor has left for you.
