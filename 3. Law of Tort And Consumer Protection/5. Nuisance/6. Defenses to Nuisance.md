### 📌 **Introduction**

When someone suffers from a **public or private nuisance**, the law provides remedies to **stop the nuisance**, **prevent future harm**, and **compensate for loss**.

### 📌 **Main Remedies**

✅ **1️⃣ Damages**

- The usual remedy for private nuisance.

- Can include:
    
    - **Compensatory damages:** For actual harm suffered.
        
    - **Exemplary damages:** Rare — only when defendant acted maliciously.
        

**Example:**  
If toxic fumes damage crops — the owner can claim the cost of damage.

✅ **2️⃣ Injunction**

- **Most common remedy** in nuisance.
    
- A court order **restraining** the defendant from continuing the nuisance.
    
- Types:
    
    - **Prohibitory injunction:** Stops the activity (e.g., stop noisy machinery).
        
    - **Mandatory injunction:** Orders positive action (e.g., remove waste, fix blocked drain).
        

**Example:**  
A factory causing noise at night may be ordered to limit working hours.

✅ **3️⃣ Abatement**

- A **self-help remedy** — the injured party removes the nuisance themselves.
    
- Lawful **only if done reasonably and peacefully**.
    
- Example:  
    ✔ Cutting tree branches hanging into your property.  
    ✔ Clearing a blocked drain that floods your land.
