Of course. Here is the final subtopic on the defenses to Nuisance.

### 5.6 Defenses to Nuisance ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: A successful defense can entirely absolve a defendant of liability. Understanding the specific defenses available in nuisance—and, just as importantly, the arguments that courts have rejected as defenses—is essential for a complete analysis of any nuisance problem. 🚫

Even if a claimant proves that the defendant's activity amounts to an unreasonable interference, the defendant may be able to escape liability by establishing a recognized legal defense.

### Valid Defenses

#### 1. Statutory Authority

This is a **complete defense**. If a defendant can show that their conduct is authorized by a statute (an Act of the Legislature), they will not be liable for a nuisance that is an **inevitable consequence** of that authorized activity.

- **Key Requirement**: The defendant must prove that they took all reasonable care and that the nuisance could not be avoided. If the nuisance arises because the statutory power was exercised negligently, the defense will fail.
    
- **Example**: A statute authorizes the construction and operation of a railway line. The noise and vibration that are the unavoidable result of running trains are not an actionable nuisance. However, if the railway company negligently fails to maintain the tracks, causing excessive and unnecessary noise, the defense would not apply to that portion of the interference.
    

#### 2. Prescription

This defense applies **only to private nuisance**, not public nuisance.

- **The Rule**: A defendant may acquire a prescriptive right to commit a private nuisance if they can prove that the nuisance has been continuing for **20 years** without interruption and without objection from the claimant.
    
- **Crucial Limitation**: The 20-year period does not begin until the activity becomes an **actionable nuisance from the claimant's perspective**.
    
- **Landmark Case**: In **_Sturges v Bridgman (1879)_**, a confectioner had used noisy machinery for over 20 years. This did not bother his neighbour, a doctor. When the doctor built a new consulting room at the end of his garden, the noise became a nuisance. The court held that the 20-year period only started when the consulting room was built and the noise became a legal nuisance. Therefore, the defense of prescription failed.

### Ineffective Defenses (Arguments that will Fail)

Courts have consistently rejected several common arguments as defenses to nuisance.

#### 1. "Coming to the Nuisance"

It is **not a valid defense** for the defendant to argue that the claimant should not be able to complain because they moved to the area when the nuisance-causing activity was already in operation. A new owner or tenant is entitled to the reasonable use and enjoyment of their land. To allow this defense would hinder the development of land near existing industrial sites.

#### 2. Public Benefit

It is **not a defense** to argue that the defendant's activity is beneficial to the public (for example, by creating jobs or providing an essential service). The law will not expect a private individual to bear the burden of a nuisance for the good of the public at large. However, the public benefit of the activity may be a factor the court considers when deciding on the appropriate **remedy** (e.g., awarding damages instead of an injunction that would close a factory).

#### 3. "Due to Many"

It is **not a defense** for a defendant to argue that their contribution to a nuisance was insignificant on its own and only became a nuisance due to the cumulative effect of the actions of many others. If the total interference is a nuisance, any person who contributes to it can be held liable.

In **Bangladesh**, these common law defenses, including the important principle that "coming to the nuisance" is not a defense, are applied by the courts in nuisance litigation.
