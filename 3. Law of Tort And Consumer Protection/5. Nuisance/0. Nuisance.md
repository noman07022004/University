Of course. Let's proceed to the main topic of Nuisance.

### 5. Nuisance ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: Nuisance is a key tort for protecting a person's use and enjoyment of their land from unreasonable interference. It is fundamental to property law and environmental disputes, involving a complex balancing act of competing interests, which makes it a frequent subject of exam questions. üè°

#### 1. Definition of Nuisance (Subtopic 5.1)

Nuisance is a tort concerned with the unlawful interference with a person's use or enjoyment of land, or of some right over, or in connection with it. It is distinct from trespass. While **trespass** is a _direct_ interference with another's possession of land, **nuisance** is an _indirect or consequential_ interference.

For example, throwing a stone onto a neighbour's land is a direct act and therefore a trespass. In contrast, allowing smoke, smells, or noise to drift from your property onto your neighbour's land is an indirect interference and is dealt with by the law of nuisance. The law recognizes two main forms of nuisance: public and private.

#### 2. Public Nuisance (Subtopic 5.2)

Public nuisance is primarily a **crime**, though it can also be a tort in certain circumstances. It is defined as an act or omission that materially affects the reasonable comfort and convenience of life of a **class of Her Majesty's subjects** (or, in the local context, a class of citizens).

- **Who is affected?** The interference must be so widespread that it affects a significant section of the community, not just a few individuals. Examples include obstructing a public highway, polluting a river, or operating a factory that emits noxious fumes over a whole neighbourhood.
    
- **Who can sue?**
    
    - As a crime, it is prosecuted by the **Attorney General** (or a similar public official) on behalf of the public.
        
    - A **private individual** can only sue in tort for public nuisance if they can prove they have suffered **special damage**. This means the claimant must show that they have suffered damage that is **over and above** that suffered by the general public. The damage must be substantial and direct.

#### 3. Private Nuisance (Subtopic 5.3)

This is the most common form of nuisance in tort law. It is an **unlawful, indirect interference with a person's use or enjoyment of land**. Unlike trespass, private nuisance is **not** actionable _per se_; the claimant must prove they have suffered damage.

The core of private nuisance is the concept of **reasonableness**. The law must balance the right of the defendant to use their land for their own purposes against the right of the claimant to enjoy their land without interference. An interference only becomes an unlawful nuisance when it is unreasonable.

To determine if an interference is **unreasonable**, the court considers several factors:

- **The Nature of the Locality**: What might be a nuisance in a quiet residential area may not be in a busy industrial zone. As the classic case _Sturges v Bridgman (1879)_ put it, "what would be a nuisance in Belgrave Square would not necessarily be so in Bermondsey." This factor is not relevant if the claimant has suffered physical damage to their property.
    
- **Duration and Frequency**: A continuous or persistent interference is more likely to be unreasonable than a temporary one.
    
- **Malice**: If the defendant acts with a malicious motive, their conduct is more likely to be found unreasonable. In _Christie v Davey (1893)_, the defendant's banging on the wall to disrupt his neighbour's music lessons was held to be a nuisance because it was done maliciously.
    
- **Claimant's Sensitivity**: The law does not protect an abnormally sensitive claimant or a delicate trade. The standard is that of a reasonable person in that locality.

#### 4. Nuisance and Fault (Subtopic 5.4)

While nuisance is a tort of strict liability concerning the land, there is an element of fault required. The modern test is one of **foreseeability**. As established in **_Cambridge Water Co v Eastern Counties Leather (1994)_**, a defendant will only be liable for damage if the damage was a **reasonably foreseeable consequence** of their use of the land. Therefore, a defendant is at fault if they continue an activity when they know or ought reasonably to know that it is causing an unreasonable interference and that damage is a foreseeable result.

#### 5. Remedies for Nuisance (Subtopic 5.5)

There are three main remedies available:

1. **Injunction**: This is the primary remedy. It is a court order prohibiting the defendant from continuing the nuisance. It can be a total ban or a partial one (e.g., limiting the hours of a noisy activity).
    
2. **Damages**: Monetary compensation for the harm suffered, such as physical damage to property, a fall in the property's value, or for the loss of enjoyment and comfort.
    
3. **Abatement (Self-Help)**: The claimant may take reasonable steps to stop the nuisance themselves, for example, by trimming the overhanging branches of a neighbour's tree.

#### 6. Defenses to Nuisance (Subtopic 5.6)

The main defenses are:

- **Statutory Authority**: It is a complete defense if the defendant can show that their actions were authorized by a statute and that the nuisance was an inevitable result of that authorized activity.
    
- **Prescription**: This applies only to private nuisance. If a nuisance has been carried on continuously for **20 years** without objection, the defendant may acquire a prescriptive right to continue it.
    
- **Ineffective Defenses**: It is generally **not** a defense to argue that the claimant "came to the nuisance" by moving into the area where the activity was already taking place.
    

In **Bangladesh**, the common law of nuisance is applied. Public nuisance is also a criminal offense under Section 268 of the Penal Code, 1860, and actions to stop public nuisances can also be brought under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, making it a key tool in environmental protection.
