## 🌳 **Main Topic: Nuisance — The Big Picture**

---

### 📌 **What is Nuisance?**

- **Nuisance** is a **civil wrong** that protects people from **unreasonable interference** with their use or enjoyment of land (or sometimes public rights).
    
- It deals with **indirect interference** — unlike trespass, which is about **direct, physical intrusion**.

### 📌 **Why It Matters**

Nuisance law strikes a **balance**:

- You have the right to use your property as you wish,
    
- But you must not harm your neighbours’ enjoyment of their property or the public’s rights.

### 📌 **Two Main Types**

1️⃣ **Public Nuisance** — affects the rights of the general public (e.g., blocking a highway, pollution of a river).

2️⃣ **Private Nuisance** — affects an individual’s use/enjoyment of their land (e.g., noise, smell, smoke).

### 📌 **Key Elements**

✔ There must be **unreasonable interference** — everyday annoyances don’t count.  
✔ Fault is usually relevant — nuisance and negligence often overlap.  
✔ Claimants usually need to show **damage or loss of enjoyment**.  
✔ Remedies include **damages**, **injunction**, or **abatement** (self-help).
