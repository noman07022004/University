Of course. Let's cover the remedies available for nuisance.

### 5.5 Remedies for Nuisance ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: The remedy is the ultimate goal of a nuisance claim, providing the legal solution to the unlawful interference. Understanding the primary remedies of injunction and damages, and the principles governing when each is awarded, is crucial for analyzing the practical resolution of disputes between landowners. üõ†Ô∏è

Once a court has determined that a defendant is liable for nuisance, it can grant one or more remedies to the claimant. The main remedies are an injunction, damages, and abatement.

### 1. Injunction

An injunction is a court order compelling a defendant to do, or refrain from doing, a specific act. It is the **primary and most common remedy** for a continuing nuisance because its main purpose is to prevent future harm.

- **Prohibitory Injunction**: This is the most frequent type, ordering the defendant to **stop** the activity causing the nuisance.
    
- **Partial Injunction**: The court can tailor the injunction to strike a balance between the interests of the parties. For example, instead of completely shutting down a noisy factory, a court might grant an injunction that restricts the noisy work to certain hours of the day.
    

As an equitable remedy, an injunction is granted at the **discretion of the court**. The court will consider all the circumstances of the case.

### 2. Damages

Damages are a monetary award to compensate the claimant for the loss suffered as a result of the nuisance. They are typically awarded for **past interference**. Damages can cover:

- **Physical damage** to the claimant's property (e.g., the cost of repairing cracks caused by vibrations).
    
- **Loss of amenity value** (sensible personal discomfort), which is a sum to compensate for the interference with the enjoyment of the land.
    
- **Consequential financial loss**, such as a loss of profits for a business affected by the nuisance.
    

#### Damages in Lieu of an Injunction

In some cases, a court may decide to award a one-off payment of damages for **future harm** instead of granting an injunction. This effectively allows the nuisance to continue but compensates the claimant for it. The classic (though now more flexibly applied) test from **_Shelfer v City of London Electric Lighting Co (1895)_** suggests this may be appropriate where the injury to the claimant is small, can be estimated in money, and it would be oppressive to the defendant to grant an injunction.

### 3. Abatement (Self-Help)

This is an extra-judicial remedy that allows the claimant to take reasonable steps to stop the nuisance themselves, without involving the court.

- **Examples**:
    
    - Trimming the branches of a neighbour's tree that overhang your property.
        
    - Unblocking a drain that is causing flooding.
        
- **Caution**: Abatement is a risky remedy. The steps taken must be **reasonable** and proportionate. If the claimant needs to enter the defendant's land to abate the nuisance, they must generally give notice first. Acting unreasonably could expose the claimant to a lawsuit for trespass or property damage.
    

In **Bangladesh**, these three remedies are well-established. **Injunctions** are a widely used and powerful remedy in property disputes, governed by the **Specific Relief Act, 1877**. The power of civil courts to award **damages** is governed by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.
