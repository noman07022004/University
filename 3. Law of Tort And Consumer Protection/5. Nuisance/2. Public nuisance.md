Of course. Let's focus on the concept of public nuisance.

### 5.2 Public Nuisance ⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: This subtopic is important for understanding how tort law addresses wrongs that affect a whole community. The key concept of 'special damage' is a crucial procedural hurdle that distinguishes a private claim from a public prosecution and is often tested. 👥

### Definition and Scope

Public nuisance is a distinct legal wrong that is both a **crime** and, in some circumstances, a **tort**. It is defined as an unlawful act or omission that endangers the life, health, property, morale, or comfort of the **public at large** or a **section of the public**.

The key feature of public nuisance is its indiscriminate nature. It affects a community or a "class of people," rather than just one or two individuals.

**Examples of public nuisance include:**

- Obstructing a public highway.
    
- Operating a factory that emits widespread noxious fumes or dust.
    
- Causing significant noise or vibrations that affect a whole neighbourhood.
    
- Polluting a river, which harms the public's right to fish or use the water.
    

In the case of **_Attorney-General v PYA Quarries Ltd (1957)_**, the court defined a public nuisance as one that is "so widespread in its range or so indiscriminate in its effect that it would not be reasonable to expect one person to take proceedings... but that it should be taken on the responsibility of the community at large."

### The Action in Tort: The "Special Damage" Rule

Since public nuisance is a crime, the primary method for stopping it is through a criminal prosecution or an action for an injunction brought by a public official, such as the **Attorney General**, on behalf of the public.

However, a **private individual** can bring a tort claim for public nuisance, but only if they can prove that they have suffered **"special damage."**

"Special damage" means the claimant must show that the harm they have suffered is:

1. **Substantial and direct**; and
    
2. **Over and above** the damage suffered by the general public. The damage must be different in **kind**, not just in degree.
    

**Examples of Special Damage:**

- **Personal Injury**: A person who trips over an obstruction on the highway and breaks their leg suffers special damage. The general public is merely inconvenienced by the obstruction, but this person has suffered a distinct physical injury.
    
- **Property Damage**: A person's house is damaged by vibrations from a quarry that affects the whole village.
    
- **Pure Economic Loss**: Uniquely, a claim for pure economic loss can be made under public nuisance. For instance, if a public road is unlawfully blocked, a cafe owner on that road who loses business suffers special damage (a direct financial loss) over and above the general inconvenience to the public.

### Public Nuisance in Bangladesh

The principles of public nuisance in Bangladesh are derived from the common law. Additionally, it has a strong statutory basis:

- **Penal Code, 1860**: Section 268 of the Code provides a criminal definition of public nuisance.
    
- **Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898**: Section 133 gives Magistrates the power to make conditional orders for the removal of public nuisances, providing a swift and effective remedy that is widely used in practice.
    

These statutory provisions make public nuisance a powerful tool for addressing community-level problems and environmental issues in Bangladesh.
