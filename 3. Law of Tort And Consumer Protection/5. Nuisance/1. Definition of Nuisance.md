## 📑 **5.1 Definition of Nuisance**

---

### 📌 **Introduction**

**Nuisance** is a **civil wrong (tort)** that deals with **indirect, unreasonable interference** with:

- a person’s use or enjoyment of **land or property**, or
    
- the general rights of the **public**.

### 📌 **General Definition**

There is **no precise statutory definition** in many common law systems.  
Instead, it has developed through **case law**.

- **Winfield’s Definition:**  
    _“Nuisance is an unlawful interference with a person’s use or enjoyment of land, or of some right over, or in connection with it.”_
    
- **Stephen’s Definition:**  
    _“Nuisance is anything done to the hurt or annoyance of the lands, tenements or hereditaments of another.”_

### 📌 **Key Features**

✔ **Indirect interference:**  
Example: Smoke, smell, noise, vibrations, pollution.

✔ **Continuous or recurring:**  
One-off acts are usually trespass or negligence, not nuisance (though there are exceptions).

✔ **Unreasonable:**  
Must be more than trivial — ordinary neighbourly inconvenience is not nuisance.

### 📌 **Two Types**

1️⃣ **Public Nuisance:**

- Interference with a right common to the general public.
    
- Example: Blocking a public road, polluting a river.
    

2️⃣ **Private Nuisance:**

- Interference with an individual’s enjoyment of their land.
    
- Example: Loud machinery, foul odour, dangerous trees.

### 📌 **Examples**

- _St. Helen’s Smelting Co. v Tipping (1865)_: Fumes from a factory damaged trees — actionable nuisance.
    
- _Halsey v Esso Petroleum Co. Ltd (1961)_: Noise and acid smuts from oil depot — nuisance.
    
- Loud music from a neighbour’s party every night — possible nuisance.

### 📌 **Important Point**

Nuisance does **not** cover **one-time physical intrusion** — that is trespass.  
It is about **indirect, unreasonable, continuing interference**.

---

### ✅ **Possible Exam Question**

> _“Define nuisance. Distinguish between public and private nuisance with examples.”_

---

### 📌 **Tip**

✔ Always mention the **two types**.  
✔ Give simple examples for both.  
✔ Use key words: _unreasonable, indirect, continuing_.

---

### ✏️ **Key Takeaway**

**Nuisance = indirect, unreasonable interference with use/enjoyment of land or public rights.**
