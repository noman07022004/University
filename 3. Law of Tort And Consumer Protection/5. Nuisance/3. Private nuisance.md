Of course. Let's explore the core concept of private nuisance.

### 5.3 Private Nuisance ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: This is the heart of the law of nuisance. It deals with the fundamental conflict between neighbours and their respective rights to use their land. The concept of 'reasonableness' and the balancing exercise the courts undertake are central to tort law and are a common feature of problem questions. üè°

Private nuisance is an **unlawful, indirect interference with a person's use or enjoyment of land**, or of some right over or in connection with it. It is the primary tort for resolving disputes between neighbouring landowners over competing land uses.

Unlike trespass, it is **not** actionable _per se_; the claimant must prove that they have suffered damage.

### Who Can Sue? (The Claimant)

To bring a claim in private nuisance, the claimant must have a **legal interest in the land** that has been affected. This means the person must have a right to the land, such as:

- An **owner** in possession.
    
- A **tenant** with a lease.
    

This rule was firmly established in the case of **_Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd (1997)_**, where the court held that a mere licensee‚Äîsuch as a family member living in a house owned by another‚Äîhas no right to sue in private nuisance. The tort protects the land itself, not the people on it.

### Who Can Be Sued? (The Defendant)

Liability for private nuisance can fall on several parties:

1. **The Creator**: The person who creates the nuisance can always be sued, even if they are no longer the occupier of the land from which the nuisance originates.
    
2. **The Occupier**: The current occupier of the land is the usual defendant. They are liable not only for nuisances they create but also for nuisances created by others (e.g., trespassers, previous occupants) if they **"adopt"** or **"continue"** the nuisance. This means they know or ought to know of its existence and fail to take reasonable steps to stop it.
    
3. **The Landlord**: A landlord is generally not liable for a nuisance created by their tenant. However, they can be liable if they have expressly or impliedly **authorized** the nuisance or if the nuisance existed at the time the property was leased.

### The Core Element: Unreasonable Interference

Not every interference with a neighbour's enjoyment of land is a nuisance. The interference must be **unreasonable**. The law seeks to strike a balance between the defendant's right to use their property as they wish and the claimant's right to enjoy their property without disturbance. It is a question of "give and take."

To determine if the interference is unreasonable, the court will balance a number of factors:

- **1. The Nature of the Locality**: The character of the neighbourhood is a key consideration. As established in _Sturges v Bridgman (1879)_, "what would be a nuisance in Belgrave Square would not necessarily be so in Bermondsey." An activity that is a nuisance in a quiet residential area may be perfectly reasonable in an industrial one. **Note**: This factor is irrelevant if the nuisance causes physical damage to the claimant's property.
    
- **2. Duration and Frequency**: The longer the interference lasts and the more often it occurs, the more likely it is to be considered unreasonable. A brief, one-off event is less likely to be a nuisance than a continuous noise.
    
- **3. Malice**: If the defendant acts out of malice or ill-will, their conduct is far more likely to be deemed unreasonable, even if it might have been acceptable otherwise. In **_Hollywood Silver Fox Farm v Emmett (1936)_**, the defendant deliberately fired a gun near the claimant's property to scare the claimant's sensitive foxes. This was held to be a nuisance because of the malicious intent.
    
- **4. Claimant's Abnormal Sensitivity**: The law does not protect an abnormally sensitive claimant or a particularly delicate use of their land. The standard is based on the effect the interference would have on a reasonable person and the ordinary use of their land. In **_Robinson v Kilvert (1889)_**, heat from the defendant's property damaged the claimant's sensitive paper stock but would not have affected ordinary paper. The claim failed as the claimant's trade was abnormally sensitive.
    

The courts in **Bangladesh** apply these same common law principles, balancing these factors to determine whether an interference is an unreasonable and therefore unlawful private nuisance.
