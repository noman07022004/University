## üìë 1.1 Concept of Tort ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important:** The concept of tort is foundational to understanding the entire course, as it defines what constitutes a tortious act and sets the stage for studying liabilities, defenses, and remedies. It‚Äôs critical for grasping how tort law protects individual rights and provides remedies in civil wrongs, especially in Bangladesh‚Äôs uncodified legal system.  
> **Why Not Less Important:** Given its role as the starting point of the syllabus, it‚Äôs a high-priority topic (4 stars) but not 5 stars, as subsequent topics like negligence or consumer protection may carry more practical weight in exams or real-world application.


### üìå Introduction

The **concept of tort** forms the cornerstone of tort law, providing a framework for addressing civil wrongs that cause harm or loss to individuals. In Bangladesh, tort law, though not codified, plays a vital role in protecting personal and property rights, drawing heavily from English common law principles. Understanding this concept is essential for law students to navigate the legal principles governing liability, remedies, and defenses in tortious actions.

### üîë What is a Tort?

A **tort** is a civil wrong, other than a breach of contract or trust, that causes harm or loss to a person, entitling the injured party to seek remedies, typically in the form of **compensation** (damages). It arises when a person‚Äôs legally protected rights are violated, either intentionally or negligently, by another‚Äôs wrongful act or omission.

- **Key Features:**
    
    - **Civil Nature:** Torts are private wrongs, addressed through civil lawsuits, unlike crimes which are public wrongs prosecuted by the state.
    - **Legal Duty:** A tort involves the breach of a duty imposed by law (not by agreement, as in contracts).
    - **Harm or Loss:** The claimant must suffer some form of harm‚Äîphysical, emotional, financial, or reputational.
    - **Remedies:** The primary remedy is monetary compensation, though injunctions or other relief may apply.
- **Examples in Bangladesh Context:**
    
    - A factory polluting a river, harming local farmers‚Äô crops (nuisance).
    - A doctor‚Äôs negligence causing patient injury (medical negligence).
    - Defamatory statements damaging someone‚Äôs reputation (defamation).

**Case Example:** _Donoghue v Stevenson (1932)_ ‚Äî Established the modern concept of negligence. A woman fell ill after drinking contaminated ginger beer, leading to the principle that manufacturers owe a duty of care to consumers, even without a contractual relationship. This case is influential in Bangladesh‚Äôs tort law framework.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Distinction from Other Legal Wrongs

Torts are distinct from other legal concepts, which helps clarify their scope:

- **Tort vs. Crime:**
    
    - **Tort:** Seeks to compensate the victim (e.g., damages for injury in a car accident).
    - **Crime:** Aims to punish the offender and punish society (e.g., imprisonment for reckless driving).
    - **Overlap:** Some acts, like assault, can be both a tort (civil claim for damages) and a crime (criminal prosecution).
- **Tort vs. Contract:**
    
    - **Tort:** Duty is imposed by law (e.g., duty to drive safely).
    - **Contract:** Duty arises from an agreement between parties (e.g., delivering goods as per a sale contract).
    - **Example:** If a builder constructs a faulty house, breaching the contract terms is a contract issue, but causing injury due to negligence is a tort.
- **Tort vs. Trust:**
    
    - **Tort:** Involves direct harm to a person or property (e.g., trespass to land).
    - **Trust:** Involves breach of fiduciary duties (e.g., a trustee misusing trust funds).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Basis of Tort Law

Tort law is grounded in the principle of **protecting legally recognized interests** (e.g., personal safety, property, reputation) and ensuring **justice** through remedies. It operates on the maxim: **‚ÄúUbi jus ibi remedium‚Äù** (where there is a right, there is a remedy).

- **Objectives:**
    
    - **Compensation:** Restoring the victim to their pre-harm position (e.g., paying for medical bills after an injury).
    - **Deterrence:** Discouraging wrongful behavior (e.g., penalizing reckless driving).
    - **Justice:** Upholding fairness by holding wrongdoers accountable.
    - **Loss Distribution:** Spreading loss across parties (e.g., through insurance in accident cases).
- **In Bangladesh:** Tort law is not codified but is applied through court decisions based on English common law and statutes like the **Fatal Accidents Act, 1855**, and principles from cases like _Donoghue v Stevenson_. It addresses local issues like road accidents, workplace injuries, and environmental harm.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Types of Torts

Torts are broadly categorized based on the nature of the wrongful act:

- **Intentional Torts:** Deliberate acts causing harm (e.g., assault, battery, defamation).
    - Example: Spreading false rumors to harm someone‚Äôs reputation.
- **Negligent Torts:** Harm caused by failure to exercise reasonable care (e.g., medical negligence, car accidents).
    - Example: A driver ignoring a stop sign, causing a collision.
- **Strict Liability Torts:** Liability without proving fault, often for inherently dangerous activities (e.g., keeping wild animals, industrial pollution).
    - Example: _Rylands v Fletcher (1868)_ ‚Äî Liability for damage caused by a reservoir flooding neighboring land.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Application in Bangladesh

In Bangladesh, tort law is primarily **judge-made**, relying on English common law principles due to the absence of a comprehensive tort statute. Courts apply tort principles in cases involving:

- **Personal Injury:** Road accidents, medical malpractice.
- **Property Damage:** Trespass, nuisance (e.g., factory emissions harming crops).
- **Reputation:** Defamation cases in media or personal disputes.
- **Statutory Overlaps:** The **Consumer Rights Protection Act, 2009**, complements tort law by addressing consumer grievances, though it‚Äôs not strictly a tort statute.

**Challenges in Bangladesh:**

- Lack of codification leads to inconsistent application.
- Limited awareness of tort remedies among the public.
- Courts often rely on English precedents, which may not fully suit local contexts.

**Case Example:** In Bangladesh, cases like road accident claims often use tort principles (e.g., negligence) alongside statutes like the **Motor Vehicles Ordinance, 1983**.
