Of course. Here is a detailed explanation of the subtopic.

### 1.1 Concept of Tort ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: This is the definitional and conceptual cornerstone of the entire subject. Understanding what a tort _is_, and what it is _not_, is the first and most crucial step to analyzing any tortious liability. Every subsequent topic assumes a firm grasp of this foundational concept.

#### Defining a "Tort"

The term "tort" originates from the French word for "wrong," which in turn comes from the Latin word _tortum_, meaning "twisted" or "crooked." In its legal sense, a tort is a civil wrong that causes a claimant to suffer loss or harm, resulting in legal liability for the person who commits the tortious act (the tortfeasor).

While there is no single, universally accepted definition, the most authoritative one is provided by **Sir John Salmond**, who defines a tort as:

> "A civil wrong for which the remedy is a common law action for unliquidated damages, and which is not exclusively the breach of a contract or the breach of a trust or other merely equitable obligation."

Let's break down this definition:

- **Civil Wrong**: A tort is a wrong against an individual or their property, as opposed to a wrong against the state. This is the primary distinction between tort law and criminal law.
    
- **Remedy is... unliquidated damages**: The primary remedy is monetary compensation that is not fixed in advance by the parties (as it might be in a contract). Instead, the amount is determined by the court based on the nature and extent of the harm suffered.
    
- **Not exclusively a breach of contract or trust**: This part of the definition highlights that tort law occupies a space in civil law distinct from other areas. The duties in tort are not created by an agreement between parties but are imposed by the law itself.
    

#### The Core Distinctions: Tort vs. Other Legal Wrongs

To fully grasp the concept of tort, it is essential to distinguish it from other types of legal wrongs.

**1. Tort vs. Crime** The same wrongful act, such as an assault, can be both a tort and a crime. However, the legal proceedings and consequences are entirely different.

|Feature|**Law of Tort**|**Criminal Law**|
|---|---|---|
|**Nature of Wrong**|It is a **private wrong** against an individual.|It is a **public wrong** against the state and society.|
|**Objective**|To **compensate** the victim for the harm suffered.|To **punish** the offender and deter future crime.|
|**Parties**|The injured party (**Plaintiff**) sues the wrongdoer (**Defendant**).|The **State** prosecutes the accused.|
|**Remedy**|**Damages** (compensation), injunctions.|**Punishment** (imprisonment, fines).|
|**Standard of Proof**|**Balance of Probabilities** (more likely than not).|**Beyond a Reasonable Doubt** (a much higher standard).|
|**Governing Law (in Bangladesh)**|Principles of common law, judicial precedents.|The Penal Code, 1860; The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898.|

**2. Tort vs. Breach of Contract** While both fall under civil law, the source and nature of the duties are fundamentally different.

- **Source of Duty**: In tort, the duty is **fixed by law** and exists independently of any agreement. For example, the duty to not cause injury through negligent driving is imposed on all drivers by law. In contract, the duty is **fixed by the parties** themselves through their agreement.
    
- **Nature of Duty**: The duty in tort is a duty _in rem_ (owed to people generally, or "the world at large"). The duty in contract is a duty _in personam_ (owed only to the specific person or persons who are parties to the contract).
    
- **Damages**: As mentioned, tort damages are **unliquidated**. In contract, damages may be **liquidated**, meaning the parties have pre-agreed on the amount payable in case of a breach. The goal of damages in tort is to restore the claimant to their pre-injury position, while in contract, it is to put the claimant in the position they would have been in had the contract been fulfilled.
    

#### Foundational Theory: Law of Tort or Law of Torts?

A key academic debate shaped the modern concept of tort.

- **"Law of Torts" (Salmond's Theory)**: This is the "pigeon-hole" theory. It posits that there is a defined list of specific, named torts (e.g., negligence, trespass, defamation). If a wrongful act does not fit into one of these existing "pigeon-holes," it is not a tort. This theory suggests a closed and rigid system.
    
- **"Law of Tort" (Winfield's Theory)**: This theory argues for a broader principle. It suggests that all harms inflicted on others are torts unless there is a justifiable reason. This view is more flexible and allows courts to create new torts in response to changing social conditions.
    

The prevailing modern view, reflected in landmark cases like **_Donoghue v Stevenson [1932]_**, aligns more closely with Winfield's theory. It treats tort law as a growing and adaptable field, capable of recognizing new wrongs as society evolves.

In **Bangladesh**, the concept of tort is wholly adopted from the English common law tradition. The courts rely on the same definitions and distinctions established in English and Indian jurisprudence to adjudicate tortious claims.
