### 1.6 Boundaries of Tort in Bangladesh ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: This subtopic is critical for understanding the practical application and current status of tort law within the Bangladeshi legal system. It explains the sources of tort law and the reasons for its unique developmental path in the country, which is essential context for a Bangladeshi law student. 🇧🇩

The boundaries of the law of tort in Bangladesh are defined by its unique legal history, sources, and the socio-economic factors that have shaped its development. Unlike many other areas of law, tort law in Bangladesh remains largely **uncodified**.

#### 1. Uncodified Nature and Sources of Law

The single most important boundary is that there is no single, comprehensive statute or "Tort Code" in Bangladesh. The law is primarily judge-made, derived from several sources:

- **English Common Law**: This is the principal source. During the British colonial period, courts were directed to decide cases where there was no specific statute according to the principles of **"justice, equity, and good conscience."** The judiciary interpreted this to mean the rules and principles of English common law, so long as they were applicable to the local context. This practice continues today, making English case law a primary reference point.
    
- **Judicial Precedents**: As a common law system, the doctrine of precedent (_stare decisis_) applies.
    
    - **Decisions of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh** are binding law.
        
    - **Decisions from foreign jurisdictions**, particularly the superior courts of the **United Kingdom** and **India**, are not binding but hold highly persuasive value and are regularly cited by lawyers and judges.
        
- **Specific Statutes**: While there is no general code, certain statutes govern specific areas of tortious liability. Examples include:
    
    - **The Fatal Accidents Act, 1855**: Allows the family of a person killed by a wrongful act to sue for compensation.
        
    - **The Motor Vehicles Ordinance, 1983**: Contains provisions related to third-party liability for motor vehicle accidents.
        
    - **The Consumer Rights Protection Act, 2009**: Creates a statutory framework for addressing consumer grievances, which overlaps significantly with torts like negligence and deceit.
        

#### 2. Challenges and Reasons for Slow Development

Historically, the law of tort has been one of the least developed areas of civil law in Bangladesh. Several factors contribute to this:

- **Lack of Awareness**: A significant portion of the population is unaware of their rights under tort law and the possibility of claiming compensation for civil wrongs.
    
- **High Cost and Delay**: The civil litigation process is notoriously slow, complex, and expensive, which discourages potential plaintiffs.
    
- **Preference for Criminal Proceedings**: For many wrongs that are both a tort and a crime (like negligent driving or assault), victims often prefer to initiate criminal proceedings. This is because the state bears the cost of prosecution and the process is often perceived as faster and more decisive.
    
- **Uncertainty**: The uncodified nature of the law can make the outcome of a tort suit seem less predictable compared to a claim based on a clear statute.
    

#### 3. Expanding Boundaries: Modern Trends

Despite these challenges, the boundaries of tort law are expanding, primarily due to the proactive role of the judiciary.

- **Constitutional Torts and Public Interest Litigation (PIL)**: The Supreme Court of Bangladesh, through its writ jurisdiction under Article 102 of the Constitution, has become a key forum for developing tort-like remedies. It has awarded compensation for the violation of fundamental rights by state authorities, creating the field of **"Constitutional Tort."**
    
- **Judicial Activism**: Courts are increasingly applying tort principles to new and emerging issues, such as **environmental pollution** (holding industries liable for damage) and **medical negligence**. Cases like **_Dr. Mohiuddin Farooque v. Bangladesh_** have expanded the scope of liability for public authorities.
    

In summary, the law of tort in Bangladesh is a dynamic field. While its traditional boundaries are shaped by its common law origins and constrained by practical challenges, its modern frontiers are being pushed forward by a judiciary willing to innovate and provide remedies for civil wrongs, especially in the realm of public law.
