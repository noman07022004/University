> **Why important:** Explains the limits of tort law in our legal system. Knowing these boundaries helps avoid over-claiming, spot where tort is not applicable, and understand the gaps in Bangladeshi law.

### **üìå Introduction**

Tort law in Bangladesh is largely **uncodified** and based on **English common law principles**, supplemented by certain statutory provisions.  
Because there is no comprehensive **Tort Act**, the application of tort law has **natural and legal boundaries**.

These boundaries define **when tort law applies, when it doesn‚Äôt, and when other branches of law take over**.

### **‚öñ Main Boundaries**

---

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Overlap with Criminal Law**

- Many wrongful acts (e.g., assault, theft, defamation) are **both crimes and torts**.
    
- If the state prosecutes, it‚Äôs a criminal case; if the individual sues for damages, it‚Äôs a tort.
    
- However, criminal remedies may sometimes replace civil claims, especially if statutory law provides full relief.
    

**Example:**  
Defamation ‚Äî can be prosecuted under **Penal Code** or sued as a tort.

---

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Overlap with Contract Law**

- If the wrong arises from a **breach of contract**, tort law usually does not apply ‚Äî unless there is an **independent duty imposed by law**.
    
- Tort and contract claims may be combined if both duties are breached.
    

**Example:**  
Doctor‚Äìpatient ‚Äî negligence may be both breach of contract and tort.

---

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Statutory Exclusions**

- Certain acts done under **statutory authority** are immune from tort liability (unless done negligently or in bad faith).
    
- Examples in Bangladesh:
    
    - Public authorities performing duties under the **Environment Conservation Act**.
        
    - Road repair works under municipal orders.
        

---

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Sovereign Immunity & Government Liability**

- Historically, acts done in the **exercise of sovereign functions** were immune.
    
- Modern trend: narrowing immunity ‚Äî government may be liable for torts in **non-sovereign functions** (e.g., running a transport service).
    
- Still, Bangladeshi courts are cautious in imposing liability on the state.
    

**Case Reference:**  
Indian case _State of Rajasthan v Vidyawati_ ‚Äî state held liable for negligent driving by government employee in non-sovereign function.

---

#### **5Ô∏è‚É£ No Action for Purely Moral Wrongs**

- Tort protects **legal rights**, not moral or social obligations.
    
- An act may be immoral but not actionable if it violates no legal duty.
    

**Example:**  
Breaking a promise to attend a friend‚Äôs wedding ‚Äî not a tort.

---

#### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Limitation Periods**

- Claims must be filed within the statutory limitation period (usually under **Limitation Act, 1908**).
    
- Delay beyond this period bars the claim, even if the tort occurred.
    

---

#### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Absence of Codification**

- Without a **comprehensive Tort Act**, courts rely on case law and analogies.
    
- This sometimes creates **uncertainty** about whether a claim exists.
