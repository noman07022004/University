Of course. Let's proceed to the next subtopic.

### 1.2 Elements ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: These three elements are the essential legal requirements for establishing almost any tort. In any problem-based question, you will be required to prove the existence of each element to make a successful claim. This is a non-negotiable, core component of tort law analysis. üèõÔ∏è

To successfully bring a claim in tort, a plaintiff must prove, on the balance of probabilities, the existence of three fundamental elements. These are the building blocks of tortious liability. The absence of any one of them will cause the claim to fail.

The three essential elements are:

1. A **Wrongful Act or Omission** by the defendant.
    
2. **Legal Damage** suffered by the plaintiff.
    
3. The availability of a **Legal Remedy**.

## 1. Wrongful Act or Omission

The first step is to establish that the defendant has committed a "wrongful act." This is not merely a moral or social wrong; it must be an act that is legally recognized as wrongful because it violates a duty imposed by the law.

- **Wrongful Act**: This refers to a positive act of commission. For example, publishing a defamatory statement, entering another person's land without permission (trespass), or unlawfully striking someone (battery).
    
- **Wrongful Omission**: This refers to a failure to act, or a negative act of omission. Liability for an omission arises only when there is a pre-existing legal duty to act. For instance, a doctor who fails to provide appropriate care to a patient in an emergency may be liable for a wrongful omission, as they have a professional duty to act. A mere bystander who sees a person drowning, however, generally has no legal duty to intervene and would not be liable for the omission.
    

The key here is the concept of a **legal duty**. Whether it's a duty to not do something (e.g., defame) or a duty to do something (e.g., take reasonable care), this duty is imposed by law, not by any private agreement.

## 2. Legal Damage

This is arguably the most critical and nuanced element. "Damage" here does not simply mean actual physical or financial loss. It means **legal damage**, which is the violation of a legally protected right. This principle is famously explained through two Latin maxims.

### _Injuria Sine Damno_

This maxim means **"legal injury without actual damage."** It applies to situations where a person's legal right is violated, even if they have not suffered any actual, quantifiable harm, loss, or expense.

- **Is it actionable?** Yes, absolutely. These torts are described as being actionable _per se_ (by themselves). The law presumes damage upon the violation of the right because the purpose is to vindicate the right itself, not just to compensate for loss.
    
- **Landmark Case**: **_Ashby v White (1703)_**. In this case, Mr. Ashby, a qualified voter, was wrongfully prevented from voting in a parliamentary election by a returning officer. The candidate he wanted to vote for won the election anyway, so he suffered no actual financial or other loss. However, the court held that his legal right to vote had been violated (_injuria_), and that was sufficient to ground a claim, even without any demonstrable damage (_damno_). Lord Holt famously stated, _"If the plaintiff has a right, he must of necessity have a means to vindicate and maintain it... it is a vain thing to imagine a right without a remedy."_
    
- **Other Examples**: Trespass to land (walking on someone's property without permission is actionable even if no grass is damaged) and libel (a defamatory written statement is actionable without proof of actual financial loss).
    

### _Damnum Sine Injuria_

This maxim means **"actual damage without legal injury."** This covers situations where a person suffers real and substantial loss or harm, but no legal right has been violated.

- **Is it actionable?** No. If no legal right has been infringed, the law provides no remedy, regardless of how great the loss. Mere harm is not a tort.
    
- **Landmark Case**: **_Gloucester Grammar School Case (1410)_**. The defendant, a schoolmaster, set up a rival school next to the plaintiff's established one. Due to the competition, the plaintiff had to reduce his fees from 40 pence to 12 pence per student, causing him significant financial loss. The court held that while the plaintiff had clearly suffered damage (_damnum_), there was no violation of a legal right (_injuria_). The defendant had a lawful right to open a school, and the resulting competition was not a legal wrong.
    
- **Other Examples**: A shop owner who loses customers and profits because a bigger, more attractive supermarket opens next door suffers _damnum_, but has no legal claim as the competitor has not violated any of their rights.

## 3. Legal Remedy

The third element requires that the wrongful act causing legal damage must be one for which the law provides a remedy. This is expressed by the maxim **_Ubi Jus Ibi Remedium_**, which means **"Where there is a right, there is a remedy."**

This principle asserts that the law will not recognize a right if it does not also provide a method to enforce it or seek redress for its violation. The existence of a right implies the existence of a remedy for its infringement. The primary remedy in tort law is an award of **unliquidated damages** (monetary compensation determined by the court). Other remedies include an **injunction** (a court order to stop a wrongful act) or **specific restitution** (an order to return property).

In the context of Bangladesh, these foundational elements are applied exactly as they are in other common law jurisdictions. The courts scrutinize claims to ensure that a wrongful act has caused the violation of a legally recognized right, giving rise to a claim for a remedy.
