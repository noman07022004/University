Of course. Here is the final subtopic under "General Principles of Tort."

### 1.9 Limitation ⭐⭐

> **Why Not as Critical**: While the limitation period is a crucial procedural bar in legal practice, its role in an academic study of tort principles is supplementary. It's a rule to be aware of rather than a complex legal concept to be analyzed in depth for most first-year exams. ⏳

#### The Concept of Limitation

The law of limitation prescribes a specific time period within which a person must file a lawsuit to seek a legal remedy. If a suit is filed after this period has expired, the court will dismiss it, regardless of the merits of the case.

The core principle behind this is the legal maxim **_Vigilantibus non dormientibus jura subveniunt_**, which means "the law assists the vigilant, not those who sleep on their rights."

The purposes of having limitation periods are to:

- Ensure that disputes are resolved in a timely manner.
    
- Prevent stale claims where evidence may be lost or memories have faded.
    
- Provide certainty and finality, allowing potential defendants to live without the indefinite threat of litigation.
    

#### The Governing Law in Bangladesh

In Bangladesh, the time limits for filing civil suits, including all tort claims, are governed by **The Limitation Act, 1908**. The First Schedule of this Act sets out the specific limitation periods for different types of lawsuits.

#### When Does the Time Start to Run?

The limitation period begins to run from the date the **cause of action accrues**. This is the point in time when the plaintiff first has the right to sue.

- For torts actionable _per se_ (e.g., trespass, libel), the time starts from the date of the wrongful act itself.
    
- For torts requiring proof of damage (e.g., negligence), the time starts from the date the damage is actually suffered.
    

#### Key Limitation Periods for Torts in Bangladesh

The Limitation Act, 1908, provides different periods for various torts. Some of the most relevant are:

- **One Year**: This is the limitation period for many common torts, including suits for:
    
    - Compensation for **libel** (Article 24)
        
    - Compensation for **slander** (Article 25)
        
    - Compensation for **false imprisonment** (Article 27)
        
    - Compensation for **malicious prosecution** (Article 23)
        
    - Compensation for **personal injury** (Article 22)
        
- **Two Years**: This is a general or "residuary" period for torts not specifically mentioned elsewhere.
    
    - **Article 36** applies to suits for compensation for any **malfeasance, misfeasance, or non-feasance** independent of contract, for which no specific period is provided.
        
- **Three Years**: This period applies to certain torts related to property, such as:
    
    - Compensation for **obstructing a way or a watercourse** (Article 37).
        

#### Consequence of Expiry

If a lawsuit is not filed within the prescribed period, the claim becomes **"statute-barred."** This means the court is legally bound to dismiss the suit. It is important to note that the underlying right of the plaintiff is not extinguished, but the **legal remedy is barred**.
