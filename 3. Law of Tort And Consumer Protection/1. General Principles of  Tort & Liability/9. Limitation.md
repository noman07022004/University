# 📑 **1.9 Limitation** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Reason for importance:** Limitation periods determine the _time frame_ within which a tort claim can be brought. Missing the deadline can completely bar a claim, no matter how strong the case is.

---

## **📌 Introduction**

The **law of limitation** in torts refers to the _statutory time limit_ within which a claimant must initiate legal proceedings. Once this period expires, the defendant can raise the **limitation defense** to avoid liability.  
In Bangladesh, limitation periods are primarily governed by the **Limitation Act, 1908**, which sets different deadlines depending on the nature of the tort.

---

## **📜 Definition**

> A _limitation period_ is the legally prescribed maximum time after an event within which proceedings may be initiated.  
> **If not filed in time → the right to sue is lost.**

## **⏳ Purpose of Limitation Laws**

1. **Certainty & Finality** – Prevents indefinite threats of litigation.
    
2. **Evidence Preservation** – Reduces risk of unreliable or lost evidence due to passage of time.
    
3. **Encourages Diligence** – Promotes timely action by claimants.
    
4. **Fairness to Defendant** – Protects from defending very old claims.

## **⚖️ Limitation in Tort – Bangladesh Context**

The **Limitation Act, 1908** does not have a single fixed period for all torts—it depends on the specific cause of action.

|Type of Tort|Common Limitation Period (Bangladesh)|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Defamation|**1 year** from publication|A newspaper falsely accuses a person of theft.|
|Assault/Battery|**1 year** from the act|A physical attack occurs in Jan 2023 → must sue by Jan 2024.|
|Trespass to Land|**2 years**|Landowner files case for trespass.|
|Negligence (personal injury)|**3 years**|Road accident injury claim.|
|General tort claims not otherwise specified|**3 years**|Economic loss claim without contract.|

_(Exact periods may vary depending on statute-specific rules.)_

## **🛠 Starting Point of Limitation Clock**

- **From the date of cause of action** – Most common rule.
    
- **From the date of knowledge** – In cases where damage is discovered later (e.g., latent injuries, hidden defects).
    
- **Continuing tort** – For ongoing wrongs, the limitation period may refresh daily until the wrongful act stops.
    

---

## **📌 Exceptions / Extensions**

Courts may extend or suspend the limitation period in certain cases:

1. **Minority** – Period starts when claimant turns 18.
    
2. **Insanity or Disability** – Period starts when disability ends.
    
3. **Fraud or Concealment** – Period starts when the fraud is discovered.
    
4. **Acknowledgment** – If the wrongdoer admits liability before limitation expires, the period may restart.

## **🛡 Defense of Limitation**

- The defendant must **plead and prove** that the limitation period expired.
    
- If established, the court will dismiss the case without hearing its merits.
    

---

## **🔍 Case Law**

- **State of Punjab v. Gurdev Singh (1991)** – Limitation runs from the date when the cause of action accrues, not when the claimant first becomes aware, unless statute provides otherwise.
    
- **Rahmatullah v. Bangladesh Biman (Bangladesh)** – Court emphasized that limitation rules must be strictly applied to avoid indefinite litigation.

## **📌 Key Takeaways**

- Limitation laws are about _procedure_, not _substance_, but they can completely bar a claim.
    
- Different torts have different limitation periods under the **Limitation Act, 1908**.
    
- The limitation clock usually starts from the cause of action but exceptions exist.
    
- Missing the limitation period → **Claim dismissed outright**.
