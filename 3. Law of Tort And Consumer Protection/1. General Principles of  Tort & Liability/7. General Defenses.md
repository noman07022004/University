Of course. Let's cover the general defenses.

### 1.7 General Defenses ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: This is a cornerstone of tort litigation and a highly examinable area. Once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the ability to identify and apply a relevant defense is crucial for determining the final outcome. You cannot properly analyze a tort problem without a mastery of these defenses. üõ°Ô∏è

General defenses are a set of arguments that a defendant can raise in court to escape or reduce tortious liability, even if the plaintiff has successfully proven all the essential elements of the tort. These are "general" because they are applicable to a wide range of torts.

### 1. _Volenti Non Fit Injuria_ (Consent)

This Latin maxim means **"to a willing person, no injury is done."** It is a complete defense. If the defendant can prove that the plaintiff voluntarily and freely consented to the risk of harm, the plaintiff cannot later sue for that harm. For the defense to succeed, two conditions must be met:

1. **Knowledge of the Risk**: The plaintiff must have had full knowledge of the nature and extent of the risk involved.
    
2. **Voluntary Consent**: The plaintiff must have freely and voluntarily agreed to accept that risk. This consent can be express (stated verbally or in writing) or implied (inferred from conduct).
    

- **Case Law**: In **_Hall v Brooklands Auto-Racing Club (1933)_**, a spectator at a motor race was injured when a car crashed. The court held that the spectator had impliedly consented to the risks inherent in attending such an event.
    
- **Limitation**: The defense is applied cautiously. Mere knowledge of a risk does not necessarily imply consent. In **_Smith v Charles Baker & Sons (1891)_**, a worker knew of the risk of a crane swinging rocks over his head, but the court held that continuing to work did not mean he had voluntarily consented to the employer's negligence.

### 2. Plaintiff the Wrongdoer

This defense is based on the maxim _ex turpi causa non oritur actio_ ("from a dishonorable cause, no action arises"). The idea is that the law will not help a plaintiff who has suffered damage while engaged in their own illegal act. However, there must be a direct connection between the plaintiff's unlawful act and the harm they suffered.

- **Example**: If two burglars are escaping and one is negligently injured by the other's driving, the injured burglar may be prevented from suing.
    
- **Limitation**: The defense is not absolute. If the defendant's act is out of all proportion to the plaintiff's wrongdoing, the defense may fail. In **_Bird v Holbrook (1828)_**, a trespasser was injured by a spring-gun. Although he was a wrongdoer, he could still claim damages because the force used by the defendant was excessive and inhumane.

### 3. Inevitable Accident

An inevitable accident is an event which could not have been prevented by the exercise of ordinary care, caution, and skill. It is an accident that is not foreseeable and cannot be avoided by any reasonable precautions. The defendant must prove that they were not negligent in any way.

- **Case Law**: In **_Stanley v Powell (1891)_**, the defendant was part of a shooting party. He fired at a bird, but a pellet glanced off a tree at an unusual angle and hit the plaintiff. The court held this was an inevitable accident for which the defendant was not liable.

### 4. Act of God (_Vis Major_)

An Act of God is a type of inevitable accident caused by powerful and extraordinary natural forces. The key features are:

1. It involves the working of natural forces.
    
2. The occurrence is extraordinary and could not have been reasonably foreseen or guarded against.
    

- **Examples**: Unprecedented storms, floods, earthquakes, or lightning strikes.
    
- **Case Law**: In **_Nichols v Marsland (1876)_**, the defendant had artificial lakes on his land. An unprecedented and extraordinarily violent storm caused the lakes to overflow and destroy the plaintiff's bridges. This was held to be an Act of God, and the defendant was not liable.

### 5. Private Defense

The law permits a person to use reasonable and proportionate force to defend their person, property, or another person from an imminent attack. The force used must not be excessive.

- **Proportionality is Key**: The force used must be proportionate to the threat. You cannot use a lethal weapon to repel a minor physical threat. For example, pushing someone who is trying to punch you is a valid private defense. Using a firearm against an unarmed trespasser who poses no physical threat would be excessive.

### 6. Necessity

This defense allows a person to interfere with the property or person of another in an emergency situation to prevent a greater harm.

- **Public Necessity**: An act done to protect the public at large. For example, demolishing a house to create a firebreak and save a town. This is often a complete defense.
    
- **Private Necessity**: An act done to protect one's own interest or property. In **_Cope v Sharpe (1912)_**, a gamekeeper set a controlled fire on the plaintiff's land to prevent a larger fire from reaching his master's property. This was held to be a necessity.

### 7. Statutory Authority

If a statute authorizes a particular act, a person cannot be sued for any damage that is the inevitable result of that act being performed. The defendant must show that they acted without negligence and that the harm was an unavoidable consequence of the statutory duty or power.

- **Example**: A railway company is authorized by law to run trains. If, despite taking all proper precautions, sparks from an engine set fire to an adjoining property, the company may escape liability under the defense of statutory authority.
    

All of these common law defenses are recognized and applied by the courts in **Bangladesh** when adjudicating tort claims.
