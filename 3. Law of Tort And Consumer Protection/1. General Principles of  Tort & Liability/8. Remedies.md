Of course. Let's discuss the available remedies in tort law.

### 1.8 Remedies ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: The pursuit of a remedy is the entire purpose of a tort claim. This topic details the legal relief a successful plaintiff can obtain. A thorough understanding of the types of damages and other remedies is essential for analyzing the consequences of a tort and is a core component of any legal examination. üèÜ

When a tort is committed, the law provides the injured party with a remedy or relief. These remedies can be broadly divided into two categories: **judicial remedies** (those granted by a court of law) and **extra-judicial remedies** (those available to a party through self-help, without court intervention).

### I. Judicial Remedies

These are the most common remedies, obtained by filing a lawsuit in court.

#### A. Damages

Damages are the primary remedy in the law of tort. It is a monetary award paid by the defendant to the plaintiff as compensation for the harm suffered. The main types of damages are:

1. **Compensatory Damages**: This is the most common form. The objective is to place the injured party in the same position they would have been in had the tort not been committed (_restitutio in integrum_). They cover both:
    
    - **Pecuniary losses**: Quantifiable financial losses like medical bills, lost wages, and property repair costs.
        
    - **Non-pecuniary losses**: Non-financial losses that are harder to quantify, such as pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of amenity (loss of the ability to enjoy life).
        
2. **Nominal Damages**: A small, token amount of money awarded when the plaintiff's legal right has been infringed, but they have suffered no actual financial loss (_injuria sine damno_). The purpose is not to compensate, but to **vindicate the plaintiff's right**. The decision in **_Ashby v White_** is a classic example where nominal damages would be appropriate.
    
3. **Contemptuous Damages**: A minimal, derisory sum (e.g., the smallest coin of the realm) awarded when the court recognizes that the plaintiff's rights were technically violated but believes the claim was trivial and brought on frivolous grounds. It signals the court's disapproval of the plaintiff's conduct in bringing the case.
    
4. **Exemplary or Punitive Damages**: These are awarded in addition to compensatory damages. Their purpose is not to compensate the plaintiff but to **punish** the defendant for outrageous, oppressive, or malicious conduct and to **deter** similar conduct in the future. They are awarded only in exceptional circumstances.
    

#### B. Injunction

An injunction is a court order that requires a person to either do a specific act or, more commonly, to refrain from doing a specific act. It is an equitable remedy granted at the discretion of the court.

- **Prohibitory Injunction**: Orders a defendant to stop doing something (e.g., stop committing a nuisance like playing loud music late at night).
    
- **Mandatory Injunction**: Orders a defendant to perform a positive act (e.g., to demolish a structure built in violation of the plaintiff's rights).
    
- **Temporary (Interlocutory) and Perpetual Injunction**: A temporary injunction is granted for a specific period or until the case is decided, to maintain the status quo. A perpetual injunction is granted after the final hearing of the case.
    

#### C. Specific Restitution of Property

This is a remedy where the court orders the defendant to return specific property to the plaintiff who was wrongfully dispossessed. This applies to both movable property (goods) and immovable property (land).

### II. Extra-Judicial Remedies (Self-Help)

These are remedies that an aggrieved person can take without recourse to a court. The law allows for self-help in limited situations, and it must always be exercised reasonably.

1. **Self-Defense**: A person may use reasonable and proportionate force to protect themselves or another person from an imminent threat.
    
2. **Recaption of Goods**: A person who has been wrongfully deprived of their goods may lawfully retake them.
    
3. **Re-entry on Land**: A person wrongfully dispossessed of land may, in certain circumstances, re-enter it, provided they do so in a peaceable manner.
    
4. **Abatement of Nuisance**: An individual may take reasonable steps to remove a nuisance. For example, one can trim tree branches that overhang from a neighbour's property and encroach upon their land.
    

In **Bangladesh**, all these remedies are recognized. **Damages** are the most common relief sought. The law relating to **injunctions** and **specific restitution** is primarily governed by the **Specific Relief Act, 1877**.
