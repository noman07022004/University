## **📌 Introduction**

Tort law is a branch of civil law concerned with **civil wrongs** that cause harm or loss to individuals, and the system of legal remedies available to those harmed.  
Unlike criminal law, which punishes offenders on behalf of society, tort law’s main purpose is to **compensate victims, deter wrongful conduct, and uphold justice between individuals**.

This topic covers the essential building blocks you must understand to grasp tort law’s scope and function.

## **1. Concept of Tort**

A **tort** is a **civil wrong**, other than breach of contract, for which the law provides a remedy.  
It involves a breach of a **legal duty** owed by the defendant to the claimant, causing harm or loss.  
Torts protect **various interests** such as personal safety, property rights, reputation, economic interests, and privacy.

## **2. Elements of Tort**

For a tort claim to succeed, the claimant must prove:

- **Duty of care** or a legal duty owed by defendant to claimant.
    
- **Breach** of that duty by defendant’s act or omission.
    
- **Causation** — the breach caused the claimant’s harm.
    
- **Damage** or loss suffered by claimant.
    
- **Absence of valid defenses** by defendant.

## **3. Variations of Tort**

Torts vary in nature and legal requirements:

- **Intentional torts:** Defendant acts deliberately (e.g., assault, trespass).
    
- **Unintentional torts:** Negligence causing harm without intent.
    
- **Actionable per se:** Wrong itself causes liability without proving damage (e.g., trespass).
    
- **Actionable on proof of damage:** Must prove actual harm (e.g., negligence).
    
- **Nominate vs. innominate torts:** Named torts with set rules vs. general duties recognized by courts.
    
- **Common law vs. statutory torts:** Developed by courts vs. created by legislation.
    
- **Private vs. public torts:** Affecting individual rights vs. community/public interest.

Tort law here is influenced by **English common law** but is **uncodified**. Its limits include:
