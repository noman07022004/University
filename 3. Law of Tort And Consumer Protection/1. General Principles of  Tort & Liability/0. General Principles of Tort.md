Of course. Let's begin with the foundational topic of the course.

### 1. General Principles of Tort ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: This topic is the bedrock of the entire course. Every specific tort, from negligence to defamation, is built upon these fundamental principles. A mastery of this area is non-negotiable for understanding tortious liability, and it is the most frequently examined topic, forming the basis for both theoretical and problem-based questions.

The law of tort is a branch of civil law concerned with providing remedies for civil wrongs that are not exclusively a breach of contract or trust. The word "tort" is derived from the Latin term _tortum_, which means "twisted" or "wrong." In essence, it is a collection of principles that dictate when one person is legally responsible for the harm they have caused to another. Unlike criminal law, which seeks to punish public wrongs, tort law's primary objective is to compensate the victim for the harm they have suffered. It operates on the standard of proof of the **balance of probabilities**, rather than the criminal standard of **beyond a reasonable doubt**. Furthermore, while contract law deals with obligations voluntarily assumed by parties, tort law deals with duties imposed by the law itself, independent of any agreement.

#### The Core Elements and Concept of Tort

At its heart, a tort is a wrongful act or omission that infringes upon a legal right of another person, giving rise to a claim for unliquidated damages (i.e., damages not pre-determined by an agreement but assessed by a court). To establish a tort, three essential elements must typically be proven:

1. **A Wrongful Act or Omission**: The defendant must have either performed an act they were not legally entitled to do or failed to perform an act they were legally obligated to perform. This duty is one imposed by law, such as the duty to not defame others or the duty to take reasonable care to avoid injuring one's "neighbour."
    
2. **Legal Damage**: The wrongful act must result in the violation of a legal right vested in the plaintiff. This concept of "legal damage" is crucial and is best understood through two Latin maxims:
    
    - **_Injuria sine damno_**: This means "legal injury without actual damage." It occurs when a person's legal right is violated, even if they suffer no actual financial loss or physical harm. Such cases are actionable _per se_ (in and of themselves) because the law values the protection of rights above the proof of tangible loss. The landmark case of **_Ashby v White (1703)_** illustrates this, where a voter was wrongfully prevented from voting. Although the candidate he intended to vote for won the election (meaning no actual damage was suffered), the court held that his legal right to vote was infringed, and thus he was entitled to a remedy.
        
    - **_Damnum sine injuria_**: This means "actual damage without legal injury." It occurs when a person suffers harm, loss, or damage, but their legal rights have not been violated. Such cases are not actionable. For example, in the **_Gloucester Grammar School Case (1410)_**, a schoolmaster set up a rival school next to an existing one, causing the original school to lower its fees and suffer a financial loss. The court held that while there was damage, there was no legal injury, as the defendant had a lawful right to open a school.
        
3. **Legal Remedy**: The wrongful act must be of a nature that gives rise to a legal remedy, encapsulated by the maxim **_Ubi jus ibi remedium_** ("Where there is a right, there is a remedy"). The most common remedy in tort is an award of **unliquidated damages** (monetary compensation). Other remedies include **injunctions** (a court order to stop doing something) and **specific restitution** of property.
    

#### Variations, Interests, and Objectives

Torts can be broadly categorized based on the mental state of the wrongdoer (**variations**):

- **Intentional Torts**: Where the defendant acts with the intention to cause the harm or knows with substantial certainty that the harm will result (e.g., Trespass, Defamation, Battery).
    
- **Negligence**: Where the harm is caused by the defendant's failure to exercise the standard of care that a reasonably prudent person would have in a similar situation. This is the most common type of tort.
    
- **Strict Liability**: Where the defendant is held liable for the harm caused by their actions, regardless of fault or intent (e.g., liability for keeping dangerous animals or under the rule in **_Rylands v Fletcher_**).
    

The law of torts aims to **protect various interests**, including:

- **Personal Interests**: Protection against physical harm (Battery), apprehension of harm (Assault), and loss of liberty (False Imprisonment).
    
- **Property Interests**: Protection of land (Trespass to Land, Nuisance) and goods (Trespass to Goods, Conversion).
    
- **Reputation**: Protection against harm to one's reputation (Defamation).
    
- **Economic Interests**: Protection against financial loss due to fraud (Deceit) or imitation (Passing Off).
    

The overarching **objectives** of tort law are compensation for victims, deterrence of wrongful conduct, and the promotion of corrective justice by holding wrongdoers accountable.

#### Boundaries of Tort in Bangladesh

In Bangladesh, the law of tort is notably **uncodified**. It is not contained within a single statute but has developed through judicial precedents. The courts in Bangladesh apply the principles of English common law based on **justice, equity, and good conscience**, as empowered by historical statutes. Consequently, decisions from English, Indian, and other common law courts are highly persuasive. The development of tort law has been relatively slow due to factors such as a lack of public awareness, high litigation costs, and a preference for other legal avenues. However, it is gaining significant traction, particularly in areas like medical negligence, environmental pollution, and constitutional torts, where the judiciary is increasingly holding both private and public bodies accountable for wrongful acts.

#### General Defenses, Remedies, and Limitation

Even if a plaintiff establishes the elements of a tort, the defendant may escape liability by proving a valid defense. These **general defenses** apply to most torts:

- **_Volenti non fit injuria_** (Consent): The plaintiff voluntarily consented to the risk of harm.
    
- **Plaintiff the Wrongdoer**: The plaintiff's own unlawful act was the determining cause of the harm.
    
- **Inevitable Accident**: The event was not foreseeable and could not have been avoided by reasonable care.
    
- **Act of God (_Vis Major_)**: A catastrophic natural event that is unforeseeable and beyond human control.
    
- **Private Defense**: The defendant used reasonable force to protect their person or property.
    
- **Necessity**: The defendant committed the tort to prevent a greater harm.
    
- **Statutory Authority**: The act causing the harm was authorized by legislation.
    

The primary **remedy** in tort is **damages**, which can be compensatory (to restore the plaintiff to their pre-tort position), nominal (a token sum where a right is violated but no loss is suffered), or exemplary (to punish the defendant for outrageous conduct). Other remedies include injunctions and the restitution of property.

Finally, the law imposes a time limit within which a tort claim must be brought, known as the period of **limitation**. In Bangladesh, this is governed by **The Limitation Act, 1908**. Different torts have different limitation periods; for example, a suit for compensation for libel or slander must typically be brought within one year of the publication. Failure to file a suit within this period permanently bars the claim.
