Of course. Let's proceed with the next subtopic.

### 1.5 Objectives ⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: This subtopic addresses the fundamental goals and social functions of the tort system. Understanding these objectives helps to explain the rationale behind legal rules and judicial decisions, providing a deeper, policy-oriented perspective on the subject. 🎯

The law of tort is not merely a set of rules for shifting losses; it is a system designed to achieve several important societal objectives. While these goals often overlap, and their relative importance can be debated, they collectively provide the justification for why tort law exists.

The primary objectives are:

---

### 1. Compensation

This is the most prominent and widely accepted objective of tort law. The primary goal is to provide monetary **compensation** to the victim of a tort for the harm they have suffered. The aim is to restore the injured party to the position they were in before the tort was committed, a principle known as _restitutio in integrum_.

- **How it's achieved**: Through the award of **damages** to cover losses such as medical expenses, lost income, property damage, and non-pecuniary harm like pain and suffering.
    
- **Underlying Principle**: This reflects the theory of **corrective justice**, which posits that a person who wrongfully causes loss to another has a moral and legal obligation to correct that loss.

### 2. Deterrence

A key function of tort law is to deter wrongful conduct. The threat of being held liable for damages is intended to discourage individuals and organizations from engaging in acts that might harm others.

- **Specific Deterrence**: Aims to prevent the _actual defendant_ from repeating their wrongful behavior.
    
- **General Deterrence**: Aims to discourage the _public at large_ from engaging in similar conduct by making an example of the defendant.
    
- **Example**: The potential for a large medical negligence lawsuit encourages hospitals to implement rigorous safety protocols. Similarly, manufacturers are deterred from marketing unsafe products by the risk of product liability claims.

### 3. Vindication of Rights

Tort law provides a mechanism for individuals to have their rights publicly affirmed and vindicated. It allows a person to stand up in court and have a wrong, which might otherwise be ignored, formally acknowledged.

- **How it's achieved**: This is particularly evident in cases where **nominal damages** (a very small sum of money) are awarded. The goal is not the financial award but the court's declaration that the plaintiff's rights were violated.
    
- **Example**: In **_Ashby v White_**, the plaintiff was awarded damages for being denied the right to vote. The case was not about compensating a financial loss but about vindicating his fundamental legal right.

### 4. Justice and Accountability

This objective is closely linked to punishment. While the primary role of punishment belongs to criminal law, tort law ensures a measure of justice by holding wrongdoers **accountable** for the consequences of their actions.

- **How it's achieved**: This objective is most clearly seen in the award of **exemplary or punitive damages**. These are damages awarded not to compensate the plaintiff, but to punish the defendant for conduct that is particularly malicious, oppressive, or outrageous, and to make an example of them.
    
- **Example**: A company that knowingly pollutes a river, showing reckless disregard for public health, might be ordered to pay punitive damages in addition to compensatory damages.

### 5. Loss Spreading

A more modern, economic objective of tort law is to spread the financial cost of accidents across society, rather than allowing it to fall crushingly on a single individual (the victim).

- **How it's achieved**: This is primarily facilitated through **liability insurance**. The defendant's insurer pays the damages, and this cost is effectively spread among all policyholders who pay premiums. **Vicarious liability** also serves this function by placing liability on employers, who are better positioned to absorb and distribute the costs (through insurance or pricing) than individual employees.
    

In the legal system of **Bangladesh**, the primary focus of tort litigation has historically been on **compensation**. However, with the development of public interest litigation and constitutional torts, the objectives of **deterrence** and **accountability**, particularly concerning state authorities, have gained significant judicial emphasis.
