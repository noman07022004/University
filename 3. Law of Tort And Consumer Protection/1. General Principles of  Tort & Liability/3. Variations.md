Of course. Here is the explanation for the next subtopic.

### 1.3 Variations ⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: Understanding these variations is key to classifying different torts and appreciating the role of the defendant's mental state. While not a standalone rule to be applied in every case, this classification underpins the analysis of every specific tort you will study.

The law of tort is not a single, uniform body of rules. Torts vary significantly based on the mental element or state of mind of the defendant at the time of the wrongful act. This "mental element" is a crucial factor in determining the basis of liability. Torts can be broadly classified into three main categories based on this element.

### 1. Intentional Torts

As the name suggests, these torts require **intent**. In the context of tort law, "intent" does not necessarily mean malice or a desire to cause harm (though that can be present). It means one of two things:

1. The person acts with the **purpose** of producing the consequence; or
    
2. The person acts knowing with **substantial certainty** that the consequence will result from their action.
    

The focus is on the deliberateness of the conduct. The motive behind the act is generally irrelevant. If you intend the act, you are liable for the consequences, even if your motive was good.

- **Examples**:
    
    - **Battery**: Intentionally causing harmful or offensive contact with another person. The intent is to make the contact, not necessarily to cause the specific injury that results.
        
    - **Trespass to Land**: Intentionally entering another person's land. You may honestly believe the land is yours, but the act of entering is intentional, which is sufficient for liability.
        
    - **Defamation**: Intentionally publishing a statement that harms another's reputation.
        
    - **Deceit (Fraud)**: Intentionally making a false statement to induce another person to act on it to their detriment.

### 2. Negligence

This is the most common and expansive category of torts. Liability here is not based on intention to cause harm, but on **fault** in the form of carelessness. Negligence occurs when a person fails to exercise the degree of care that a reasonably prudent person would have exercised under similar circumstances.

The defendant does not desire the harmful outcome, but their unreasonable conduct creates a foreseeable risk of that outcome. The mental state is one of carelessness, inadvertence, or a failure to think things through.

- **Core Idea**: The tort of negligence is about breaching a legal **duty of care** owed to another person, which results in damage.
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - **Road Accidents**: A driver who is texting and causes a collision has not intended to crash, but their careless conduct makes them liable in negligence.
        
    - **Medical Malpractice**: A surgeon who leaves a surgical instrument inside a patient has not done so intentionally, but has fallen below the standard of care expected of a surgeon.
        
    - **Occupiers' Liability**: The owner of a shop who fails to clean up a spill, leading a customer to slip and fall, is liable for their negligent omission.

### 3. Strict Liability

This category is unique because it imposes liability **without fault** (_sine culpa_). In a strict liability tort, the plaintiff does not need to prove that the defendant acted intentionally or negligently. The defendant can be held liable even if they took every possible precaution to prevent the harm.

Liability is based on the nature of the activity the defendant is engaged in, which is often considered inherently dangerous or for which public policy demands the actor bear full responsibility for any resulting harm.

- **Rationale**: The law places the risk of loss squarely on the person who engages in the high-risk activity, as they are in the best position to manage and insure against that risk.
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - **The Rule in _Rylands v Fletcher_**: A person who, for their own purposes, brings onto their land and collects and keeps there anything likely to do mischief if it escapes, is held strictly liable for the damage that is the natural consequence of its escape.
        
    - **Liability for Animals**: In many jurisdictions, the keeper of a wild animal (e.g., a lion) is strictly liable for any harm it causes.
        
    - **Vicarious Liability**: An employer is held "strictly" liable for torts committed by their employee in the course of employment, even though the employer themselves was not at fault.
        

These three variations form the framework for analyzing tortious liability in Bangladesh, just as they do in other common law systems.

|Variation|Basis of Liability|Defendant's Mental State|Core Example|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Intentional Torts**|Intentional Wrongdoing|Purpose or Substantial Certainty|Trespass, Battery|
|**Negligence**|Carelessness / Fault|Failure to exercise reasonable care|Car Accidents|
|**Strict Liability**|Liability without Fault|Irrelevant|Rule in _Rylands v Fletcher_|
