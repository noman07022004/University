### üìå Introduction

The **variations of tort** refer to the different categories of torts based on the defendant‚Äôs conduct and the basis of liability. These classifications‚Äîintentional, negligent, and strict liability torts‚Äîprovide a framework for analyzing civil wrongs, from deliberate harms to unintentional injuries. In Bangladesh‚Äôs uncodified tort law system, rooted in English common law, understanding these variations is essential for applying tort principles to cases like road accidents, defamation, or environmental harm, as outlined in the syllabus.

### üîë Main Variations of Torts

Torts are primarily classified into three categories based on the defendant‚Äôs state of mind and liability:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Intentional Torts

- **Definition:** Torts where the defendant **deliberately** commits a wrongful act causing harm to the claimant or their property.
- **Key Features:**
  - The act is intentional, though the specific harm may not be intended.
  - The claimant must prove the defendant‚Äôs intent to act.
  - Remedies include damages or injunctions.
- **Examples in Syllabus:**
  - **Trespass:** Unlawful interference with a person (assault, battery), land, or goods.
    - Example: Physically striking someone without consent (battery).
  - **Defamation:** Publishing false statements that harm reputation.
    - Example: False media reports in Bangladesh damaging a politician‚Äôs reputation.
  - **Deceit:** Intentionally misleading someone, causing loss.
    - Example: Selling counterfeit goods as genuine in a Dhaka market.
- **Bangladesh Context:** Intentional torts are common in personal disputes (e.g., assault) or media-related defamation cases, with courts applying English common law principles.
- **Case Example:** _Wilkinson v Downton (1897)_ ‚Äî Intentionally causing emotional distress via a prank was tortious, a principle relevant for intentional torts in Bangladesh.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Negligent Torts

- **Definition:** Torts where the defendant **fails to exercise reasonable care**, causing harm without intent.
- **Key Features:**
  - Requires proof of duty of care, breach, causation, and harm.
  - Focuses on careless behavior, not intent.
  - Most prevalent tort category in practice.
- **Examples in Syllabus:**
  - **Negligence:** Failure to act reasonably, causing harm.
    - Example: A Khulna doctor‚Äôs misdiagnosis leading to patient injury (medical negligence).
  - **Nuisance (partly):** Careless interference with land use.
    - Example: A factory‚Äôs negligent emissions causing health issues for nearby residents.
- **Bangladesh Context:** Negligence dominates in road accidents and malpractice cases, often supported by statutes like the **Motor Vehicles Ordinance, 1983**.
- **Case Example:** _Donoghue v Stevenson (1932)_ ‚Äî Established the negligence principle, widely applied in Bangladesh for defective products or services.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Strict Liability Torts

- **Definition:** Torts where the defendant is liable **regardless of intent or negligence**, often for inherently dangerous activities.
- **Key Features:**
  - No need to prove fault; liability is automatic if harm occurs.
  - Applies to high-risk activities or objects.
  - Limited defenses (e.g., act of God, claimant‚Äôs consent).
- **Examples in Syllabus:**
  - **Liability for Animals:** Owners are liable for harm by dangerous animals.
    - Example: A wild animal escaping and injuring someone in a Bangladeshi village.
  - **Nuisance (partly):** Environmental harms like pollution may attract strict liability.
    - Example: A chemical spill damaging farmland, regardless of precautions.
- **Bangladesh Context:** Strict liability applies in rare cases like industrial accidents, though limited by lack of codification.
- **Case Example:** _Rylands v Fletcher (1868)_ ‚Äî Liability for a reservoir flooding neighboring land, applicable in Bangladesh for similar environmental harms.

---

### üìö Additional Classifications of Torts

Torts can also be categorized by the **type of harm** caused, distinct from the liability-based variations above. This classification is relevant to the syllabus and helps in understanding torts like trespass or defamation.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Torts Against the Person

- Involve harm to an individual‚Äôs body, freedom, or reputation.
- **Examples in Syllabus:**
  - Assault, battery, false imprisonment, defamation.
  - Example: Unlawfully detaining someone during a dispute in a Bangladeshi market (false imprisonment).

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Torts Against Property

- Involve interference with land or goods.
- **Examples in Syllabus:**
  - Trespass to land, nuisance, conversion.
  - Example: Illegally entering a farmer‚Äôs land in Khulna (trespass).

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Torts Against Economic Interests

- Involve harm to financial or business interests.
- **Examples in Syllabus:**
  - Deceit, passing off, malicious falsehood.
  - Example: Selling fake products under a reputed brand‚Äôs name in Dhaka (passing off).

---

### üåç Application in Bangladesh

- **Legal Framework:** Bangladesh‚Äôs tort law, being uncodified, relies on English common law and judicial precedents. Courts apply intentional, negligent, and strict liability torts in cases like road accidents (negligence), media defamation (intentional), or industrial pollution (strict liability/nuisance).
- **Challenges:** Limited codification and public awareness restrict strict liability cases, with negligence being most common due to frequent accidents and malpractice claims.
- **Statutory Overlaps:** The **Consumer Rights Protection Act, 2009**, addresses harms like defective products, complementing tort law but not replacing it.

## üìë **1.3 Variations of Tort** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why important:** Helps classify torts into different categories, making it easier to understand their scope, application, and defenses. This is often tested in exams to assess your ability to differentiate between types of tortious liability.

---

### **üìå Introduction**

While all torts share the **core elements** (duty, breach, causation, damage, remedy), they vary in **nature, origin, and requirements**.  
Understanding these variations is crucial because different torts have different **rules, defenses, and remedies**.

---

### **üîç Main Variations of Tort**

---

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Intentional vs. Unintentional Torts**

- **Intentional torts**
    
    - Defendant **deliberately** engages in conduct that causes harm.
        
    - _Examples:_ Assault, battery, false imprisonment, trespass, defamation.
        
    - **Key point:** Intention to cause harm or perform the act itself is necessary.
        
- **Unintentional torts**
    
    - Harm caused by **negligence or carelessness**, without intent.
        
    - _Examples:_ Road accidents, professional malpractice.
        
    - **Key point:** Focus on the standard of care, not the defendant‚Äôs mental state.
        

**Case:** _Letang v Cooper_ ‚Äî negligence distinguished from intentional battery.

---

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Actionable Per Se vs. Actionable on Proof of Damage**

- **Actionable per se**
    
    - No need to prove actual damage; violation of the right itself is enough.
        
    - _Examples:_ Trespass to land, false imprisonment.
        
- **Actionable on proof of damage**
    
    - Must show actual harm or loss.
        
    - _Examples:_ Negligence, nuisance.
        

**Case:** _Ashby v White_ ‚Äî right violation actionable without damage.

---

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Nominate vs. Innominate Torts**

- **Nominate torts**
    
    - Specific, named torts with well-defined rules (e.g., defamation, nuisance, trespass).
        
- **Innominate torts**
    
    - Not specifically named; liability arises from breach of general legal duty.
        
    - _Example:_ Negligent misstatement (recognized after _Hedley Byrne v Heller_).
        

---

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Common Law vs. Statutory Torts**

- **Common law torts**
    
    - Developed by judicial precedents over centuries.
        
    - _Example:_ Negligence (Donoghue v Stevenson).
        
- **Statutory torts**
    
    - Created by legislation.
        
    - _Example in Bangladesh:_ Breach of duties under Consumer Rights Protection Act.
        

---

#### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Private vs. Public Torts**

- **Private torts**
    
    - Affect individual rights; remedies claimed by individuals.
        
    - _Examples:_ Trespass, defamation.
        
- **Public torts (wrongful acts affecting community)**
    
    - Often overlap with criminal law; remedies may include state action.
        
    - _Example:_ Public nuisance.
        

---

### **‚öñ Bangladesh Context**

- Most tort claims here are **common law based** (borrowed from English and Indian law).
    
- Some tortious acts are partly covered by statutory provisions, e.g., Motor Vehicles Ordinance, 1983; Consumer Rights Protection Act, 2009.
