Of course. Let's focus specifically on the defense of Justification.

### 6.6 Justification ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: This is the most fundamental and powerful defense in defamation law. It provides a complete answer to a claim because the law's primary purpose is to protect true reputations, not to penalize the publication of truth. Understanding this defense is non-negotiable. ✅

#### The Principle of Justification (Truth)

Justification, more commonly known today as the defense of **Truth**, is a **complete defense** to a claim of defamation. If a defendant can prove that the defamatory statement they published is true, the claimant's lawsuit will fail.

- **Rationale**: The core rationale is a matter of public policy. The law of defamation exists to protect a person's well-deserved reputation. It does not exist to allow a person to recover damages for the publication of truthful information, even if that information is damaging. The law will not protect a reputation that is not earned.
    
- **Burden of Proof**: A crucial aspect of this defense is that the **burden of proof lies entirely on the defendant**. The claimant does not have to prove the statement was false. It is up to the defendant to prove to the court, on the balance of probabilities, that their statement was true.

#### The Standard: Substantial Truth

The defendant is not required to prove the literal truth of every single word of the defamatory statement. The legal standard is one of **substantial truth**.

This means the defendant must prove that the main point, or the **"sting of the libel,"** is true. Minor inaccuracies that do not affect the core defamatory meaning of the statement will not defeat the defense.

- **Example**: A newspaper publishes that Mr. X was convicted of stealing ৳50,000. If Mr. X was in fact convicted of stealing ৳45,000, the defense of justification would likely succeed. The "sting" of the allegation—that Mr. X is a convicted thief who stole a significant sum of money—is substantially true. The minor inaccuracy in the amount is irrelevant.
    
- **Key Case**: In **_Alexander v North Eastern Railway Co (1865)_**, a notice stated that the claimant was sentenced to a fine or three weeks' imprisonment. The actual sentence was a fine or two weeks' imprisonment. The court held that the statement was substantially true and the defense was successful.

#### Distinguishing Justification from Fair Comment

It is important not to confuse this defense with fair comment.

- **Justification** is a defense for statements of **fact**.
    
- **Fair Comment** is a defense for statements of **opinion**.
    

If the defendant claims their statement was a "justified fact," they must prove it is true. If they claim it was a "fair comment," they must prove it was an honest opinion based on true facts.

#### Justification in the Bangladeshi Context

The defense of justification (truth) is a cornerstone of the civil law of defamation as applied in Bangladesh. However, there is an important distinction in the **criminal law**. Under **Section 499 of the Penal Code, 1860**, truth is only a defense if the statement was published for the **"public good."** This adds an extra requirement that is not present in the civil tort, making the defense harder to establish in a criminal prosecution.
