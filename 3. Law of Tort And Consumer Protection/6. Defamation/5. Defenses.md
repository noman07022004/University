Of course, let's cover the crucial topic of defenses to defamation.

### 6.5 Defenses ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: The defenses are where the crucial balance between freedom of expression and protection of reputation is struck. A successful defense completely defeats a defamation claim, making this a complex, policy-rich, and highly examinable area of the law. üõ°Ô∏è

Once a claimant has successfully proven the three elements of a defamation claim (that the statement was defamatory, referred to them, and was published), the burden of proof shifts to the defendant. The defendant can avoid all liability if they can establish one of the following major defenses.

---

### 1. Justification (or Truth)

This is a **complete defense**. If the defendant can prove that the defamatory statement is substantially true, the claim will fail.

- **Rationale**: The purpose of defamation law is to protect a person's true reputation, not to allow them to claim damages for the publication of truthful, albeit damaging, information about themselves.
    
- **Burden of Proof**: The burden is on the **defendant** to prove the truth of the statement.
    
- **Substantial Truth**: The defendant does not need to prove the literal truth of every single word. They must prove that the main "sting," or the core substance of the allegation, is true. For example, if a newspaper wrongly reports someone stole 5 cars when they in fact stole 4, the defense of justification would likely succeed because the sting of the allegation (being a car thief) is true.

### 2. Fair Comment on a Matter of Public Interest

This defense protects the honest expression of **opinion**, not assertions of fact. It is a cornerstone of free speech, particularly for critics, reviewers, and commentators. For this defense to succeed, four conditions must be met:

1. **The Statement Must Be an Opinion**: The words must be a comment or opinion, not an assertion of a fact.
    
2. **Based on True Facts**: The opinion must be based on true facts that are either stated or referred to in the publication. You cannot invent facts and then offer an opinion on them.
    
3. **Matter of Public Interest**: The comment must be about a matter of genuine public interest, such as the conduct of politicians, the quality of a play or book, or the management of public institutions.
    
4. **The Comment Must Be "Fair"**: "Fair" in this context means **honest**. The question is whether the defendant honestly held that opinion. The defense will be defeated if the claimant can prove the defendant acted with **malice** (i.e., they did not genuinely hold the opinion or were motivated by spite).

### 3. Privilege

In certain situations, public policy requires that people be able to speak freely without the fear of a defamation lawsuit. In these circumstances, the law grants immunity from suit, known as "privilege." There are two types:

#### A) Absolute Privilege

This is a **complete and indefeasible defense**. It cannot be defeated, even if the statement was made maliciously and the defendant knew it was false.

This powerful protection is granted only in very limited situations where complete freedom of speech is considered essential:

- Statements made in **Parliamentary proceedings**.
    
- Statements made during **judicial proceedings** by the judge, lawyers, jury, or witnesses.
    
- Communications between high-ranking state officials.
    

#### B) Qualified Privilege

This is a more common but weaker form of privilege that **can be defeated by proof of malice**.

It applies when the person making the statement has a **duty or interest** (legal, social, or moral) to communicate it to a person who has a **corresponding duty or interest** to receive it.

- **Classic Examples**:
    
    - Giving an honest job reference to a prospective employer.
        
    - Reporting a suspected crime to the police.
        
    - A company's internal report about an employee's conduct.
        

If the claimant can prove that the defendant made the statement for an improper motive (e.g., out of personal hatred), the defense of qualified privilege is lost.

These common law defenses are all recognized and applied in civil defamation cases in **Bangladesh**.
