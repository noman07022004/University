Of course. Let's cover the essential element of publication.

### 6.4 Publication ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: Publication is an essential, non-negotiable element of a defamation claim. Without it, there is no tort. Understanding its specific legal meaning, the repetition rule, and its application in the digital age is crucial for any defamation analysis. 📧

#### The Definition and Rationale

In the law of defamation, "publication" has a specific, technical meaning. It is defined as the **communication of the defamatory statement to at least one person other than the claimant themselves.**

The rationale behind this requirement is simple: the tort of defamation protects **reputation**. A person's reputation is the estimation in which they are held by **other people**. If no third party hears or sees the defamatory statement, then the claimant's reputation in the eyes of others cannot have been harmed, and therefore, no tort has been committed.

- **Example**: Insulting someone directly to their face in a private room is not defamation. However, whispering the same insult to a third person is publication.

### Key Principles of Publication

#### 1. Foreseeable Publication

The publication does not need to be intentional. It is sufficient if the defendant was **negligent**, meaning it was reasonably foreseeable that a third party would see or hear the defamatory statement.

- **The Letter Example**: If a defendant sends a defamatory letter directly to the claimant, it is not published if only the claimant reads it. However, if the letter is sent to a business address where it is common practice for a secretary or assistant to open the mail, and the secretary reads it, that constitutes a foreseeable publication (_Theaker v Richardson_).
    
- **The Eavesdropper Example**: Conversely, if a letter is opened and read by an "unforeseeable eavesdropper" (e.g., a burglar who steals the letter), there is no publication because this was not a reasonably foreseeable outcome (_Huth v Huth_).
    

#### 2. The Repetition Rule

This is a critical principle: **Every repetition of a defamatory statement is a new publication and creates a fresh cause of action.**

This means that not only the original author of a statement can be sued, but also every person who repeats or republishes it. In the context of social media, a person who writes a defamatory post, as well as those who share or retweet it, can all be held liable for publication.

#### 3. Husband and Wife

A long-standing, though somewhat archaic, common law rule states that communication of a defamatory statement from one spouse to another does not constitute publication. The law historically considered a husband and wife to be a single legal entity. However, communication by a third party _to_ a spouse about the other spouse _is_ a valid publication.

#### 4. Internet Publication

The principles of publication apply directly to the internet, but with a vast potential audience.

- **Posting a statement** on a website, blog, social media platform, or online forum is a clear act of publication.
    
- **Liability of Intermediaries**: Internet Service Providers (ISPs), social media platforms, and website hosts can also be considered "publishers." However, many jurisdictions have specific laws that provide them with a defense if they can show they were unaware of the defamatory content and acted promptly to remove it once notified.
    

In **Bangladesh**, these common law principles of publication are applied by the courts. With the rapid growth of the internet and social media, cases of online defamation and the application of the repetition rule in a digital context are becoming increasingly significant legal issues, often intersecting with laws such as the Cyber Security Act.
