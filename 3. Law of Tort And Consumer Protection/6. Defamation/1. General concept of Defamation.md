Of course. Let's start with the first subtopic on the general concept of defamation.

### 6.1 General Concept ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: This is the starting point for the entire topic of defamation. It defines the tort, explains the interest it protects, and sets out the three essential elements that form the structure of every defamation claim. Mastering this concept is a prerequisite for analyzing any defamation case. 📝

#### The Interest Protected: Reputation

The law of defamation is primarily concerned with protecting a person's **reputation**. It's important to understand that reputation is not what you think of yourself; it is the estimation in which you are held by other people. It is an external, social asset. The law of defamation therefore seeks to balance the fundamental right to freedom of expression against an individual's right to their good name.

#### The Definition of a Defamatory Statement

The classic legal definition of a defamatory statement is one which:

> "tends to lower a person in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally; or which tends to cause him to be shunned or avoided."

This definition has several key aspects:

- **"Lower a person in the estimation..."**: This means the statement damages a person's standing in the community by making others think less of them. Common examples include allegations of corruption, dishonesty, incompetence, or immorality.
    
- **"Right-thinking members of society generally"**: This sets an objective standard. The statement is judged by the standards of ordinary, decent, and fair-minded people, not by a niche group that might have unusual beliefs.
    
- **"Shunned or avoided"**: This covers statements that might not imply moral blame but would still lead people to avoid the person, for example, a false allegation that someone is insane or has a contagious disease.

### The Three Essential Elements of Defamation

For a claimant to succeed in any defamation lawsuit, they must prove three core elements on the balance of probabilities.

**1. The Statement Must Be Defamatory** The claimant must first prove that the words or images themselves have a defamatory meaning. This meaning can be plain and obvious (the natural and ordinary meaning) or it can be a hidden meaning, known as an **innuendo**.

**2. The Statement Must Refer to the Claimant** The claimant must show that the defamatory statement would be understood by a reasonable person to be about them. This is straightforward if the claimant is named. However, the reference can also be indirect. The test is objective; it does not matter if the defendant did not _intend_ to refer to the claimant.

- The classic case is **_Hulton & Co v Jones (1910)_**, where a newspaper published a fictional story about the questionable behaviour of a man named Artemus Jones. By pure coincidence, a real barrister with that name existed, and his friends thought the article was about him. The newspaper was held liable for defaming him, despite the lack of intent.
    

**3. The Statement Must Be Published** In the law of defamation, "publication" has a special, technical meaning: **the communication of the defamatory statement to at least one person other than the claimant themselves.**

- **Rationale**: The tort protects reputation, and a person's reputation cannot be damaged if no one else knows about the defamatory statement. An insult made privately to the claimant is not defamation.
    
- **Example**: Sending a defamatory letter directly to the claimant which they alone read is not publication. However, if it is reasonably foreseeable that a third party (like a secretary or spouse) might read the letter, that would constitute publication.
    

In **Bangladesh**, a civil claim for the tort of defamation is built upon these same three essential elements, which are derived directly from English common law.
