Of course. Let's proceed to the next major topic, Defamation.

### 6. Defamation ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: This tort protects the invaluable asset of reputation from unjust attacks. The distinction between libel and slander, the technical requirements like 'publication', and the various complex defenses (especially justification and privilege) make this a challenging and frequently examined area. üó£Ô∏è

#### 1. General Concept (Subtopic 6.1)

Defamation is the publication of a statement which tends to lower a person in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally, or which causes them to be shunned or avoided. The tort protects a person's interest in their **reputation**‚Äîthat is, what other people think of them, not what they think of themselves.

To succeed in a defamation claim, a claimant must prove three essential elements:

1. The statement was **defamatory**.
    
2. The statement **referred to the claimant**.
    
3. The statement was **published** to a third party.

#### 2. Libel and Slander (Subtopic 6.2)

Defamation is divided into two forms based on the medium of communication.

- **Libel**: This is defamation in a **permanent** form. This includes writing, emails, social media posts, newspapers, images, films, and statues. Libel is **actionable _per se_**, meaning the claimant does not have to prove they suffered any actual damage. The law presumes that a permanent statement will cause harm. Libel is also a crime.
    
- **Slander**: This is defamation in a **transient** or temporary form, primarily spoken words or gestures. Slander is generally **not** actionable _per se_. The claimant must prove they have suffered **special damage** (a tangible, usually financial, loss).
    

There are, however, four exceptions where slander **is** actionable _per se_:

1. Imputing that the claimant has committed a serious criminal offense.
    
2. Imputing that the claimant has a contagious or infectious disease.
    
3. Imputing unchastity or adultery to a woman.
    
4. Imputing incompetence or unfitness in the claimant's profession, trade, or business.

#### 3. Innuendo (Subtopic 6.3)

A statement can be defamatory either in its natural and ordinary meaning or by **innuendo**. An innuendo is a hidden or secondary defamatory meaning that is only understood by people who have special knowledge of extrinsic facts.

- **Example**: Publishing a statement that "Mrs. X gave birth to twins" is not defamatory on its face. However, to people who know that Mrs. X was only married one month ago, the statement carries the innuendo that she is unchaste, and is therefore defamatory.

#### 4. Publication (Subtopic 6.4)

"Publication" is a technical legal term. It means the **communication of the defamatory statement to at least one person other than the claimant**. If the statement is only communicated to the claimant, their reputation in the eyes of others cannot have been damaged.

Every repetition of a defamatory statement is a new publication, creating a new cause of action against each person who repeats it.

#### 5. & 6. Defenses to Defamation (Subtopics 6.5 & 6.6)

Even if a statement is defamatory, the defendant will not be liable if they can prove a valid defense.

- **Justification (or Truth) (Subtopic 6.6)**: This is a **complete defense**. If the defendant can prove that the "sting" of the defamatory statement is substantially true, the claim will fail. The law does not protect a reputation that is not deserved. The burden of proof is on the defendant.
    
- **Fair Comment**: This defense protects honest expressions of **opinion** on matters of **public interest**, provided the opinion is based on true facts. The opinion must be one that an honest person could hold, and the defense is defeated if the claimant can prove the defendant acted with malice.
    
- **Privilege**: The law recognizes that in certain situations, public policy requires people to be able to speak freely. This immunity is called privilege.
    
    - **Absolute Privilege**: This provides a complete and indefeasible defense, even if the statement was made maliciously. It applies to statements made in parliamentary and judicial proceedings, and communications between high officers of the state.
        
    - **Qualified Privilege**: This is a weaker defense that is defeated by proof of malice. It applies where the maker of the statement has a duty or interest to communicate it to a person who has a corresponding duty or interest to receive it (e.g., a job reference).

#### 7. Remedies (Subtopic 6.7)

- **Damages**: This is the primary remedy. The amount awarded depends on the seriousness of the allegation, the extent of the publication, and the claimant's standing.
    
- **Injunction**: A court order to prohibit the publication or further publication of a defamatory statement. Courts are cautious about granting these before a trial to protect freedom of speech.
    
- **Apology**: While a court cannot order an apology, a prompt and full apology can reduce the amount of damages awarded.
    

In **Bangladesh**, the law of defamation is based on these English common law principles. Crucially, defamation is also a criminal offense under **Section 499 of the Penal Code, 1860**, and it is common for aggrieved parties to pursue a criminal prosecution rather than (or in addition to) a civil claim in tort.
