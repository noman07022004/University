Of course. Let's look at the two forms of defamation: libel and slander.

### 6.2 Libel and Slander ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: This is the fundamental classification of defamatory statements. The distinction is critical because it determines whether the tort is actionable _per se_ or requires proof of special damage, which can make or break a claimant's entire case. ‚úçÔ∏è vs. üó£Ô∏è

The tort of defamation is divided into two separate forms based on the medium of communication. The legal consequences for each are significantly different.

### Libel

**Definition**: Libel is the publication of a defamatory statement in a **permanent** form.

- **Medium**: This includes any lasting medium that can be seen.
    
    - **Traditional examples**: Writing, printing in books or newspapers, statues, and pictures.
        
    - **Modern examples**: Emails, websites, social media posts (on platforms like Facebook, X, or Instagram), videos, and films. Broadcasts on television and radio are also treated as libel, as their impact is wide and they are often recorded.
        
- **Key Legal Consequence**: Libel is **actionable _per se_**. This is the most important feature. It means the claimant **does not** have to prove they suffered any actual, tangible damage or financial loss. The law presumes that a defamatory statement in a permanent form will cause serious harm to a person's reputation.
    
- **Criminal Offense**: Libel is also recognized as a criminal offense.

### Slander

**Definition**: Slander is the publication of a defamatory statement in a **transient** or temporary form.

- **Medium**: This primarily consists of **spoken words** or **physical gestures**.
    
- **Key Legal Consequence**: The general rule is that slander is **not** actionable _per se_. To succeed in a claim for slander, the claimant **must prove special damage**.
    
- **Special Damage**: This means the claimant must show evidence of a tangible loss, which can be valued in money, that they suffered as a direct result of the slander. Examples include the loss of a job, the loss of a specific business contract, or being refused service. Mere emotional distress or social isolation is usually not enough to qualify as special damage.
    

#### Exceptions to the Rule for Slander

In four exceptional cases, the law considers the slander to be so serious that the claimant does **not** need to prove special damage. In these situations, slander is actionable _per se_, just like libel.

1. **Imputation of a Serious Crime**: To allege that the claimant committed a criminal offense that is punishable by imprisonment.
    
2. **Imputation of a Contagious Disease**: To allege that the claimant is currently suffering from a serious contagious or infectious disease (historically, leprosy or a venereal disease), which would cause them to be shunned by society.
    
3. **Imputation of Unchastity**: To allege that a woman or girl is unchaste or has committed adultery.
    
4. **Imputation of Unfitness in Profession or Business**: To make a statement that attacks a person's professional competence or integrity. This is the most common and important exception today.

### Summary Table

|Feature|**Libel**|**Slander**|
|---|---|---|
|**Form**|Permanent (e.g., written, broadcast)|Transient (e.g., spoken, gestures)|
|**Actionable?**|**Yes, _per se_** (no proof of damage needed)|**No** (proof of special damage is required)|
|**Damage**|Presumed by the law|Must be proven by the claimant (unless an exception applies)|
|**Criminal Law**|Can be a crime|Generally, not a crime in common law traditions|

In **Bangladesh**, this common law distinction between libel and slander is followed in civil tort claims. However, the criminal law of defamation, as defined in Section 499 of the Penal Code, 1860, does not draw as sharp a distinction between the two.
