Of course. Let's cover the subtopic on feminist perspectives.

### 9.5 Feminist Perspectives ⭐⭐

> **Why Not as Critical**: This is a critical legal theory, not a legal doctrine. It provides a framework for analyzing and critiquing tort law from a specific social perspective. It is valuable for developing a sophisticated, academic understanding but is not a rule applied in legal problem-solving. ♀️

#### The Core Idea of Feminist Jurisprudence

Feminist jurisprudence, or a feminist perspective on law, is a school of thought that examines how the law may be biased due to its historical creation and interpretation in a patriarchal society. It asks whether the legal system, including the law of tort, reflects and reinforces male experiences and priorities, potentially to the disadvantage of women.

A feminist analysis of tort law asks: **Does the tort system value and respond to harms typically suffered by women in the same way it does for harms traditionally associated with men?**

#### Key Feminist Critiques of Tort Law

Feminist scholars have identified several areas where traditional tort law may contain a gender bias:

**1. The Hierarchy of Harms** The law has traditionally prioritized redressing physical and tangible harm (like a broken bone or property damage) over emotional, psychological, or relational harm.

- **The Critique**: Feminist scholars argue that harms disproportionately experienced by women—such as sexual harassment, emotional distress, or the psychological trauma of abuse—have historically been undervalued or not recognized as standalone torts. The law's long-standing reluctance to award damages for psychiatric injury ("nervous shock") is often cited as an example.
    

**2. The "Reasonable Person" Standard** The objective "reasonable person" standard in negligence, while intended to be neutral, is argued to be based on a male norm of behavior.

- **The Critique**: This standard may fail to account for the lived experiences of women. For example, in a self-defense case, a woman's "reasonable" perception of a threat might differ from a man's due to different experiences of physical vulnerability, but the law might not fully recognize this difference.
    

**3. The Valuation of Damages** The way courts calculate damages for loss of future earnings is often based on a person's income from paid employment.

- **The Critique**: This can systemically disadvantage women. A woman who is a primary caregiver, works part-time, or is in a lower-paying sector may receive significantly less compensation for a career-ending injury than a man, even if the injury has an equally devastating impact on her life. This approach effectively devalues unpaid domestic labor.
    

**4. Domestic Violence** While an act of domestic violence is technically the tort of battery, the tort system has proven largely ineffective at providing remedies in this context.

- **The Critique**: Courts have historically been reluctant to interfere in the "private" domestic sphere, and the focus of tort law on discrete, individual incidents struggles to address the ongoing, coercive, and controlling nature of much domestic abuse.
    

These critiques highlight how seemingly neutral legal principles can have a disproportionate impact based on gender.

In **Bangladesh**, these feminist perspectives are highly relevant. The ineffectiveness of tort law in addressing harms like domestic violence is a clear issue, leading victims to rely on specific criminal statutes like the **Prevention of Women and Children Repression Act, 2000**, rather than the common law of tort.
