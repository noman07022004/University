Of course. Let's cover the important topic of Constitutional Tort in Bangladesh.

### 9.4 Constitutional Tort and Contemporary Issues: Constitutional Tort in Bangladesh ⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: This is a vital area of modern Bangladeshi public law that provides a powerful, judge-made remedy for state wrongdoing. It represents a dynamic area of judicial activism and is a crucial mechanism for citizen redress where the traditional tort system fails. 🇧🇩

#### The Concept of Constitutional Tort

A **"Constitutional Tort"** is a legal action where a court awards **monetary compensation** as a public law remedy for the violation of a citizen's **Fundamental Rights** by the **State** or its agents (e.g., police, government officials).

It is not a traditional common law tort. The duty that is breached is not a duty of care, but a **duty imposed directly by the Constitution**. The defendant is always the State, which is held vicariously liable for the unconstitutional actions of its employees.

#### The Legal Basis in Bangladesh: A Judicial Innovation

The Constitution of Bangladesh does not contain an explicit provision that allows for awarding damages for the violation of fundamental rights. This remedy is a powerful example of **judicial innovation** by the Supreme Court of Bangladesh.

The power is derived from the Court's broad writ jurisdiction under **Article 102 of the Constitution**. This article empowers the High Court Division to issue any necessary orders or directions to enforce the fundamental rights. The Supreme Court has interpreted this power to include the ability to award compensation as an effective and sometimes necessary remedy.

#### Key Principles and Purpose

- **Vindicating Rights**: The primary purpose of the compensation is not just to cover the victim's financial loss, but to **vindicate the supreme importance of the fundamental right** that was violated.
    
- **Deterrence and Accountability**: The remedy is intended to deter future unconstitutional conduct by state officials and to hold the State accountable for the actions of its agents.
    
- **When it is Used**: The remedy has been most notably used in cases involving the violation of the **Right to Life and Personal Liberty (Article 32)** and the **Right to be Protected from Torture (Article 35)**. This includes cases of:
    
    - Deaths in police custody.
        
    - Unlawful arrest and detention.
        
    - Torture by law enforcement.
        
    - Enforced disappearances.
        

**Landmark Case: _Bilkis Akhter Hossain v Bangladesh and others_** In this seminal case, a man was arrested by police and subsequently died in custody as a result of torture. His widow filed a writ petition seeking a remedy. The Supreme Court found that the victim's fundamental right to life had been violated by agents of the State. The Court held the State vicariously liable and ordered it to pay substantial compensation to the victim's family.

This and similar judgments established that the State cannot hide behind the defense of "sovereign immunity" for the violation of fundamental rights and that monetary compensation is a just and proper remedy.

Constitutional tort is one of the most significant contemporary developments in Bangladeshi law, providing a crucial tool for citizens to seek redress against the State where the traditional tort system is often slow and ineffective.
