Of course. Let's cover this final subtopic on theoretical foundations.

### 9.6 Sexual Disclosure and Privacy Law ⭐⭐

> **Why Not as Critical**: This is a highly specific and contemporary application of privacy law. While socially very important, it serves as a case study for the broader principles of privacy rather than being a standalone legal doctrine in a foundational tort course. 📱

#### The Harm: A Modern Challenge

This subtopic deals with the harm caused by the **non-consensual disclosure of private sexual information or images**. The most well-known example of this is **"revenge porn,"** where an individual distributes intimate images of a former partner without their consent.

This act causes profound harm, including severe psychological distress, public humiliation, harassment, and a lasting violation of personal dignity and autonomy. It is a problem that has been greatly amplified by the internet and social media.

#### The Inadequacy of Traditional Torts

The traditional "patchwork" of torts is ill-equipped to provide a proper remedy for this specific harm:

- **Defamation**: This is the most obvious but flawed option. Defamation provides a remedy for **false** statements. In cases of "revenge porn," the images are usually **true**, meaning the powerful defense of justification (truth) would defeat a defamation claim.
    
- **Breach of Confidence**: This is a better fit, as it can protect true information that was shared in a confidential relationship. However, it may not cover all scenarios, such as when an image is stolen by a hacker rather than shared by an ex-partner.

#### The Modern Solution: The Law of Privacy

The modern, human-rights-based law of privacy provides the most direct and effective solution through the tort of **Misuse of Private Information**.

Applying the two-stage test to this scenario makes the position clear:

**1. Reasonable Expectation of Privacy?** An individual has the **highest possible reasonable expectation of privacy** in relation to intimate images of themselves. The fact that an image was once shared consensually with a partner does **not** diminish the expectation that it will remain private from the rest of the world. This first stage is almost always satisfied in these cases.

**2. The Balancing Act** The court must then balance the claimant's right to privacy against the publisher's right to freedom of expression. In cases of non-consensual sexual disclosure, there is typically **no legitimate public interest** to justify the publication. It is not a contribution to public debate; it is a malicious act designed to humiliate. Therefore, the claimant's right to privacy will overwhelmingly outweigh any claim to freedom of expression.

#### The Bangladeshi Context

In Bangladesh, this issue is primarily addressed through **criminal law** rather than tort law, reflecting the seriousness with which it is viewed.

- **Statutory Protection**: The key laws are the **Pornography Control Act, 2012**, and the **Cyber Security Act, 2023** (which replaced the Digital Security Act, 2018).
    
- **Effect**: These laws criminalize the non-consensual capture, possession, and distribution of pornographic or sexually explicit material. They provide for severe punishments, including imprisonment and fines.
    

While the constitutional **right to privacy (Article 43)** provides a strong basis for the future development of a civil tort remedy in Bangladesh, the current primary legal response to non-consensual sexual disclosure is through these specific and powerful criminal statutes.
