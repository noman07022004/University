### 9.2 Necessity and Feasibility of a Compensation Statute in Bangladesh ⭐⭐

> **Why Not as Critical**: This is a policy-oriented topic focused on legal reform in Bangladesh, rather than an existing legal doctrine. It's important for a critical analysis of the justice system but is not a rule to be applied in a typical problem question. 🇧🇩

This subtopic moves from analyzing the law as it is, to considering how it could be reformed to better serve the needs of society in Bangladesh.

#### The Problem: Why a Statute Might Be Necessary

The current system of tort law in Bangladesh has largely failed to provide an effective mechanism for compensating victims of accidents. The **necessity** for reform, potentially through a dedicated compensation statute, arises from several key problems:

1. **Uncodified and Inaccessible Law**: The law of tort is based on complex and evolving English common law principles, making it difficult for the public to understand and for lawyers to apply with certainty.
    
2. **High Burden of Proof**: In a negligence claim, the victim has the difficult and expensive task of proving that the defendant was at fault. This can be almost impossible in cases like a hit-and-run road accident.
    
3. **Slow and Expensive Litigation**: The civil court process in Bangladesh is notoriously slow, with cases often taking many years to resolve. For a victim who has lost their income and is facing medical bills, this is not a practical option.
    
4. **The "Justice Gap"**: The combination of these factors means that the vast majority of people wrongfully injured in Bangladesh receive no compensation at all.

#### The Solution: What a Compensation Statute Could Do

A well-designed compensation statute could address these problems by:

- **Codifying the Law**: Creating clear, written rules for liability and the assessment of damages.
    
- **Establishing Tribunals**: Creating specialized bodies, like a Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, to handle claims quickly and efficiently, outside of the formal civil court system.
    
- **Introducing No-Fault Liability**: For certain categories of accidents, a statute could introduce a **"no-fault" scheme**. Under such a scheme, a victim would be entitled to compensation from a central fund without having to prove who was at fault. This would guarantee at least some support for all victims.
    
- **Creating a Compensation Fund**: The statute could establish a fund, financed by a levy on vehicles or compulsory insurance, to ensure that compensation is available even if the person at fault is uninsured or cannot be identified.

#### The Challenge: The Feasibility of a Statute

While the necessity is clear, the **feasibility** of implementing such a scheme in Bangladesh faces significant challenges:

- **Financial Feasibility**: A no-fault scheme requires a robust funding mechanism. This would depend on a well-regulated and widely adopted compulsory insurance market, which is still developing in Bangladesh.
    
- **Administrative Feasibility**: Setting up and staffing a nationwide network of effective and efficient tribunals would be a major administrative and logistical undertaking.
    
- **Political Feasibility**: Implementing major reforms that affect powerful industries (like transport and insurance) requires significant and sustained political will.
    

**Current Status**: The **Road Transport Act, 2018** is a significant step in this direction. It contains provisions for financial assistance to road accident victims and their families. However, the full and effective implementation of these compensation mechanisms remains a major challenge, highlighting the gap between legislative intent and practical reality.
