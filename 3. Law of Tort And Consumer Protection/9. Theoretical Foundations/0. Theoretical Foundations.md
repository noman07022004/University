Of course. Let's cover the final section of Section A, focusing on the theoretical and contemporary issues in tort law.

### 9. Theoretical Foundations and Contemporary Issues ⭐⭐

> **Why Not as Critical**: This topic focuses on the theoretical, social, and political dimensions of tort law rather than its specific rules. While essential for a critical, academic understanding, it is less focused on the direct application of legal tests that are common in problem-based exams. 🤔

This topic moves beyond the specific rules of torts to examine the wider purposes, social functions, and contemporary challenges of the tort system, with a special focus on the Bangladeshi context.

#### 1. Tort as a Compensation Culture (Subtopic 9.1)

The term "compensation culture" is a critique, suggesting a society where individuals are encouraged to blame others for their misfortunes and sue for compensation for any injury. The primary purpose of tort law is indeed **compensation**, but the "culture" argument suggests this has gone too far, leading to:

- A "blame and claim" mentality.
    
- Increased insurance costs for everyone.
    
- "Defensive practices" where organizations avoid beneficial activities (like school trips) for fear of litigation.
    

While this is a major debate in countries like the USA and the UK, its relevance in **Bangladesh** is limited. Due to the high cost, slow pace, and lack of public awareness, tort litigation is very rare, and the country is far from having a "compensation culture." The challenge in Bangladesh is not too much litigation, but too little.

#### 2. Necessity and Feasibility of a Compensation Statute in Bangladesh (Subtopic 9.2)

Given that the uncodified, common-law tort system fails to provide compensation to most victims in Bangladesh, there is a strong argument for the **necessity** of a statutory compensation scheme.

- **The Need**: A statute could create a clear, accessible system for compensating victims of common accidents (e.g., road accidents, industrial injuries). It could establish **no-fault liability schemes** or specialized tribunals to ensure faster and more certain outcomes than a traditional lawsuit.
    
- **The Feasibility**: The main challenge is feasibility. A comprehensive scheme would require significant funding (either from the government or a robust, compulsory insurance system) and the administrative infrastructure to manage it. The **Road Transport Act, 2018**, which includes provisions for a compensation fund for accident victims, is a legislative step in this direction, but its full implementation has faced challenges.

#### 3. Medical Malpractice and Liability in Bangladesh (Subtopic 9.3)

This is a major contemporary issue. While the legal principles of medical negligence (the _Bolam_ test) are applied in Bangladesh, patients face an **accountability gap**. It is extremely difficult to bring a successful civil claim due to a lack of expert witnesses, high costs, and a general lack of awareness. This has led many to pursue criminal action under the Penal Code instead. This highlights a key theoretical debate: is the traditional tort system the best way to ensure professional accountability and patient safety, or are alternative systems needed?

#### 4. Constitutional Tort in Bangladesh (Subtopic 9.4)

This is one of the most important contemporary developments in Bangladeshi law.

- **Concept**: A "Constitutional Tort" is a legal action where the court awards monetary **compensation** for the violation of a citizen's **Fundamental Rights** by the **State** or its agents.
    
- **Legal Basis**: This remedy is not explicitly written in the Constitution. It has been innovated by the Supreme Court of Bangladesh under its writ jurisdiction (**Article 102**). In cases of unlawful detention or death in custody, the Court has held the State vicariously liable and ordered it to pay compensation to the victims or their families.
    
- **Significance**: Constitutional tort is a powerful tool for ensuring state accountability and providing a remedy where the traditional tort system is ineffective.

#### 5. & 6. Feminist Perspectives and Sexual Disclosure (Subtopics 9.5 & 9.6)

- **Feminist Perspectives**: Feminist legal theory critiques traditional tort law as having been developed from a male perspective, sometimes failing to adequately recognize or value harms that disproportionately affect women. For example, the historical reluctance to recognize psychiatric harm and the way damages are calculated (often prioritizing loss of income from paid work) have been criticized as containing gender bias.
    
- **Sexual Disclosure and Privacy Law**: A key contemporary issue is the non-consensual publication of private sexual images ("revenge porn"), a harm that disproportionately affects women. This highlights a gap in traditional law:
    
    - **Defamation** is useless if the images are true.
        
    - **Breach of Confidence** may apply, but is not a perfect fit.
        

This is precisely where the modern, human-rights-based tort of **Misuse of Private Information** (as discussed in Topic 7) becomes essential. It directly addresses this harm by protecting a person's "reasonable expectation of privacy," showing how tort law can evolve to address modern, gendered harms.
