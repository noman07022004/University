### 9.3 Negligence and Malpractice: Medical Malpractice and Liability in Bangladesh ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: This subtopic focuses on one of the most socially significant applications of negligence law in Bangladesh. It moves beyond the legal test to explore the practical challenges and the 'accountability gap' that exists, which is a key contemporary issue. üè•

#### The Legal Framework

**Medical malpractice** (or medical negligence) is not a separate tort. It is the application of the general principles of the **tort of negligence** to the actions of healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, and hospitals.

- **The Legal Standard**: As discussed previously, the standard of care required of a doctor in Bangladesh, following the common law, is that of a reasonably competent medical professional in their field. The **Bolam Test** is the guiding principle: a doctor is not negligent if they have acted in accordance with a practice accepted as proper by a responsible body of their peers.
    

While the legal principles for establishing liability exist on paper, the central issue in Bangladesh is the vast gap between this theory and the practical reality for patients seeking justice.

#### The "Accountability Gap": Practical Barriers to Civil Claims

In Bangladesh, it is extremely difficult for a patient to successfully sue a doctor in a civil tort claim for compensation. This creates a significant "accountability gap." The main barriers are:

1. **Difficulty in Obtaining Expert Evidence**: To prove a doctor was negligent, a patient needs another medical expert to testify that the treatment fell below the accepted standard. There is a well-documented "culture of silence" within the medical community, making it very difficult to find a doctor willing to testify against a colleague.
    
2. **High Cost and Delays**: Civil litigation is prohibitively expensive and slow. For a family dealing with the consequences of a medical injury, the time and money required for a lawsuit are often insurmountable obstacles.
    
3. **Lack of Awareness**: Many citizens are not aware of their legal right to seek compensation for medical negligence through the tort system.

#### The Shift to Criminal Law

Due to the immense challenges of bringing a civil claim, aggrieved patients and their families in Bangladesh often resort to the **criminal justice system** as an alternative route for seeking accountability.

- **The Law**: The most commonly used provision is **Section 304A of the Penal Code, 1860**, which deals with "causing death by a rash or negligent act."
    
- **Why it is Used**:
    
    - The State bears the cost of prosecution.
        
    - The process is often perceived as faster and more decisive than a civil suit.
        
    - It focuses on **punishment** (imprisonment or a fine) rather than compensation, which may be the primary goal for those seeking to hold a doctor accountable.
        

This trend is problematic because the standard of proof in criminal law ("beyond a reasonable doubt") is much higher than in a civil claim ("balance of probabilities"). It uses a blunt instrument (criminal law) to address an issue (professional carelessness) that is often better suited to the nuanced standards of tort law.

This situation highlights a core theoretical problem: the traditional tort system is largely failing to provide an effective remedy for medical malpractice in Bangladesh, leading to a justice gap and pushing people towards less appropriate legal avenues.
