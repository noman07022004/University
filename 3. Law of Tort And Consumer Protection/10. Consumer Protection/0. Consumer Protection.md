#### The Shift from _Laissez-Faire_ (Subtopic 10.3)

Historically, commercial law was governed by the philosophy of **laissez-faire**, which means minimal government interference in the market. The corresponding legal principle was **_caveat emptor_**, or **"let the buyer beware."** This doctrine placed the full responsibility on the buyer to assess the quality and suitability of goods before making a purchase.

This system became untenable in modern, complex economies. The individual consumer lacks the bargaining power, knowledge, and resources to deal with large corporations on an equal footing. This imbalance of power led to unsafe products, unfair terms, and deceptive practices. In response, the law globally shifted away from _caveat emptor_ towards a new model of **consumer protection**, which recognizes the need to actively protect the consumer.

#### Definitions under the Consumer Rights Protection Act, 2009 (Subtopic 10.1)

In Bangladesh, the primary law is the **Consumer Rights Protection Act, 2009 (CRPA)**. It provides key definitions:

- **Consumer**: A person who, not for commercial or resale purposes, buys or agrees to buy any goods, or hires or avails of any service.
    
- **Anti-Consumer Rights Practice**: This is a crucial concept, defined as any act that harms consumer rights. Examples given in the Act include:
    
    - Selling goods at a price higher than that fixed by law.
        
    - Knowingly selling adulterated or counterfeit goods.
        
    - Using false weights or measures.
        
    - Making false or deceptive advertisements to mislead consumers.
        
    - Failing to provide a promised warranty or guarantee.

1. **The Right to Safety**: To be protected from goods and services that are hazardous to life and property.
    
2. **The Right to be Informed**: To be given the facts needed to make an informed choice, including information on quality, quantity, purity, and price.
    
3. **The Right to Choose**: To have access to a variety of goods and services at competitive prices.

#### The Institutional Framework: The Consumer Council (Subtopic 10.2)

The CRPA, 2009, establishes a two-tier institutional framework to enforce these rights:

- **The National Consumer Rights Protection Council**: This is a high-level policy-making body, headed by the Minister for Commerce. Its role is to advise the government and formulate policies for the protection of consumer rights.
    
- **The Directorate of National Consumer Rights Protection (DNCRP)**: This is the key executive and enforcement agency. Its functions include:
    
    - Receiving and investigating complaints from consumers.
        
    - Conducting market surveillance and taking action against violators.
        
    - Imposing penalties, such as fines and, in some cases, imprisonment.
        
    - Raising public awareness about consumer rights.
        

A consumer who has a complaint can file it with the DNCRP, which has the power to investigate and provide a remedy.
