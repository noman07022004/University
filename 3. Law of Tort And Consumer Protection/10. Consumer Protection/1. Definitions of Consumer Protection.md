Of course. Let's start Section B with the definitions under consumer protection law.

### 10.1 Definitions ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: In any statutory area of law, the definitions are the building blocks. Understanding the specific legal meaning of terms like 'consumer' and 'anti-consumer rights practice' as defined in the Consumer Rights Protection Act, 2009, is the essential first step to applying the Act correctly. 📖

Unlike the common law torts which are defined by judges, the principles of consumer protection in Bangladesh are primarily governed by a specific statute: the **Consumer Rights Protection Act, 2009 (CRPA)**. The scope and application of this law depend entirely on the key definitions provided in Section 2 of the Act.

### Key Definition 1: "Consumer"

The entire Act is designed to protect the "consumer," so the definition of this term is the starting point.

According to **Section 2(19) of the CRPA**, a "consumer" is a person who:

1. Buys or agrees to buy goods, **other than for resale or for any commercial purpose**; or
    
2. Hires or avails of any service, **other than for any commercial purpose**.
    

**Analysis of the Definition:**

- **"Goods" and "Services"**: These terms are defined very broadly to cover almost anything a person can buy or hire.
    
- **The Crucial Exclusion - "Commercial Purpose"**: This is the most important part of the definition. The Act is designed to protect ordinary individuals in their personal capacity, not businesses transacting with other businesses. A business that buys raw materials or goods for resale is expected to rely on other laws, like the Contract Act, 1872, and the Sale of Goods Act, 1930.
    

**Example**:

- A person who buys a bottle of milk from a shop for their family to drink **is a consumer**.
    
- A restaurant owner who buys 100 bottles of milk to use for making sweets to sell in their restaurant **is not a consumer** under this Act for that transaction.

### Key Definition 2: "Anti-Consumer Rights Practice"

This is the core definition of the wrongful act that the law prohibits. It is defined in **Section 2(20)** as any act that is prejudicial to the rights of a consumer. Chapters 4 and 5 of the Act provide a detailed list of these prohibited practices, which include:

- **Pricing Violations**: Not displaying a price list or charging a price higher than the one displayed (**Section 38**).
    
- **Packaging and Information**: Not clearly stating the weight, quantity, ingredients, expiry date, price, etc., on the packaging of a product (**Section 37**).
    
- **Adulteration and Counterfeiting**: Knowingly selling adulterated food or medicine, or counterfeit goods (**Sections 41, 43**).
    
- **Deceptive Advertising**: Making false or misleading advertisements to trick consumers (**Section 44**).
    
- **False Weights and Measures**: Using inaccurate scales or measures to cheat customers (**Section 46**).
    
- **Failure to Provide Documents**: Not providing a receipt for a sale or a promised warranty/guarantee for a product (**Section 45**).
    

Understanding these specific definitions is essential because a person can only bring a complaint under the CRPA, 2009, if they are a "consumer" who has been harmed by an "anti-consumer rights practice."
