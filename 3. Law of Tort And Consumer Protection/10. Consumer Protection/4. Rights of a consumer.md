### 10.4 Rights of a Consumer ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: This subtopic articulates the fundamental entitlements that form the basis of all consumer protection law. These rights define what consumers can expect from the marketplace and are the specific entitlements that the Consumer Rights Protection Act, 2009, is designed to enforce. üõçÔ∏è

The global consumer protection movement is founded on a set of internationally recognized rights. These rights form a "charter" that defines the entitlements of a consumer in the marketplace. The **Consumer Rights Protection Act, 2009 (CRPA)** of Bangladesh is designed to protect and enforce these core rights.

#### The Core Consumer Rights

**1. The Right to Safety** This is the right to be protected against goods and services that are hazardous to health and life.

- **In Bangladesh**: This is a critical right protected by the CRPA, which prohibits the sale of **adulterated** food or medicine (**Sections 41, 43**) and any goods that are dangerous to life or security (**Section 42**).
    

**2. The Right to be Informed** This is the right to have access to accurate and honest information in order to make an informed choice. This includes information about a product's quality, quantity, purity, price, and expiry date.

- **In Bangladesh**: This right is strongly enforced by the CRPA through:
    
    - The requirement to display a price list (**Section 38**).
        
    - The mandate to have clear labels on product packaging (**Section 37**).
        
    - The prohibition of false and misleading advertisements (**Section 44**).
        

**3. The Right to Choose** This is the right to have access to a variety of goods and services at competitive prices.

- **In Bangladesh**: The CRPA supports this right by prohibiting practices that restrict the market, such as **hoarding** products to create an artificial shortage (**Section 40**). This right is also protected by broader laws like the **Competition Act, 2012**.
    

**4. The Right to be Heard** This is the right to have consumer interests represented in the making of government policy and in the development of products and services.

- **In Bangladesh**: This right is institutionalized through the **National Consumer Rights Protection Council**, which includes members from consumer organizations to ensure their voice is heard at the policy level.
    

**5. The Right to Redress** This is the right to receive a fair remedy for a legitimate complaint. It includes compensation for misrepresentation, defective goods, or unsatisfactory services.

- **In Bangladesh**: This is the core enforcement right provided by the CRPA. Consumers can file complaints with the **Directorate of National Consumer Rights Protection (DNCRP)**, which has the power to investigate, impose penalties, and provide redress to the consumer.
    

**6. The Right to Consumer Education** This is the right to acquire the knowledge and skills needed to be an informed and assertive consumer.

- **In Bangladesh**: The CRPA mandates the Council and the Directorate to take steps to raise public awareness and educate people about their consumer rights.
