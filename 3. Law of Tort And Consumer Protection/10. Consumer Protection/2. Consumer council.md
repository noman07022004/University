### 10.2 Consumer Council ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: This subtopic explains the institutional framework responsible for overseeing and implementing consumer rights in Bangladesh. Understanding the role and composition of the Council is key to appreciating how the Consumer Rights Protection Act, 2009, is intended to function at a national policy level. üèõÔ∏è

#### The Institutional Framework

To ensure that the rights of consumers are protected in practice, the **Consumer Rights Protection Act, 2009 (CRPA)** establishes an institutional framework. This framework has two main parts: a high-level policy-making body and an executive enforcement body. This subtopic focuses on the policy-making body.

#### The National Consumer Rights Protection Council

The official name of this body is the **National Consumer Rights Protection Council** (_Jatiyo Vokta Odhikar Shongrokkhon Parishad_). It is established under Section 5 of the CRPA, 2009.

- **Primary Role**: The Council is **not** an organization that consumers file their complaints with. Instead, it is the **apex policy-making and advisory body** for consumer protection in Bangladesh. Its main purpose is to oversee the entire consumer rights regime and guide its strategic direction.

#### Composition of the Council

The structure of the Council, outlined in Section 6 of the Act, is designed to be broad and representative of all major stakeholders.

- **Chairperson**: The Minister for Commerce.
    
- **Vice-Chairperson**: The Secretary of the Ministry of Commerce.
    
- **Membership**: The Council is a large body that includes high-level representatives from:
    
    - Various government ministries (e.g., Finance, Law, Health, Industries).
        
    - National trade and industry bodies (such as the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry - FBCCI).
        
    - Consumer rights organizations.
        
    - Professional groups like journalists and doctors.
        
    - The Director-General of the enforcement agency.
        

This multi-stakeholder composition ensures that government, business, and consumer perspectives are all considered in the policy-making process.

#### Functions of the Council

According to Section 8 of the Act, the main functions of the Council are to:

- **Formulate policies** for the protection and promotion of consumer rights.
    
- **Provide advice** to the Government on how to better implement consumer protection laws.
    
- **Coordinate** the activities of various organizations working in the field of consumer rights.
    
- **Recommend publicity and awareness campaigns** to educate the public.
    
- **Monitor** the overall enforcement of the CRPA, 2009, across the country.
    

#### The Council vs. The Directorate

It is essential to distinguish the Council from the enforcement agency:

- **The Council (_Parishad_)**: The high-level **policy-making** and advisory body. It's the "brain" of the system.
    
- **The Directorate (_Odhidoptor_)**: The **Directorate of National Consumer Rights Protection** is the executive and **enforcement** agency. This is the body that actually investigates consumer complaints, conducts market surveillance, and imposes penalties. It is the "hands" of the system.
