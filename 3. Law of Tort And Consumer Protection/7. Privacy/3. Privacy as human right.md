Of course. Let's cover the final subtopic on privacy as a human right.

### 7.3 Privacy as a Human Right ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: This subtopic provides the modern legal and moral foundation for the protection of privacy. Understanding privacy as a fundamental human right is essential to comprehending why and how courts have developed new legal remedies to protect it against intrusion, especially from the media and the state. 📜

The evolution of privacy protection in modern law is a direct result of its recognition as a fundamental human right. This shifted the legal thinking from indirectly protecting privacy through other torts to seeing it as a core right that demands direct protection.

#### Privacy in International Law

The right to privacy is firmly established as a universal human right in major international legal instruments.

- **Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) (1948)**: **Article 12** of the UDHR states:
    
    > "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks."
    
- **International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) (1966)**: **Article 17** of this legally binding treaty reiterates the right to privacy in almost identical terms, obligating state parties to adopt legal measures to protect it.
    

These instruments established privacy as a core principle of international human rights, creating a standard for domestic legal systems around the world.

#### The European Model: Balancing Rights

The **European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)** has been particularly influential in developing an actionable legal framework for privacy in common law. The key provisions are:

- **Article 8**: Guarantees the **"right to respect for private and family life, his home and his correspondence."** This is the foundation of the right.
    
- **Article 10**: Guarantees the **"right to freedom of expression."**
    

The modern legal approach to privacy cases involves a direct **balancing act** between the claimant's Article 8 right to privacy and the defendant's (often the media's) Article 10 right to free speech.

### Privacy as a Fundamental Right in Bangladesh

The right to privacy is explicitly recognized and protected in the **Constitution of Bangladesh**.

- **Article 43: Protection of Home and Correspondence**: This article is the primary source of the right. It states that every citizen has the right, subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by law:
    
    - "(a) to be secure in his home against entry, search and seizure; and"
        
    - "(b) to the privacy of his correspondence and other means of communication."
        
- **Interpretation**: This provides an explicit fundamental right to privacy. As a constitutional right, its primary application is **"vertical,"** meaning it protects citizens from arbitrary interference by the **State** and its agencies. It does not automatically create a tort action between two private citizens (a "horizontal" effect).
    
- **Article 32: Right to Life**: The Supreme Court of Bangladesh has interpreted the "right to life and personal liberty" under Article 32 in a broad and purposive manner. In several landmark judgments, the Court has held that the right to life includes the right to live with **human dignity**, and this right to dignity implicitly includes the **right to privacy**.
    

This judicial activism demonstrates that while a distinct tort of privacy between private individuals is still developing in Bangladesh, the constitutional framework and its expansive interpretation by the courts provide a powerful legal basis for protecting privacy as an essential human right.
