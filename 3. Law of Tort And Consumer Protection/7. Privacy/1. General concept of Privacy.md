Of course. Let's start with the first subtopic for Privacy.

### 7.1 General Concept ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: This subtopic establishes the foundational understanding of privacy in common law. It explains the traditional absence of a single privacy tort and introduces the 'patchwork' of other legal actions that were historically used to protect privacy interests, providing the essential context for modern developments. üèõÔ∏è

#### Defining the Concept of Privacy

The concept of privacy is broad and multi-faceted. It is famously defined as **"the right to be let alone."** This encompasses several distinct but related rights:

- **Territorial Privacy**: The right to be free from physical intrusion into one's home and private spaces.
    
- **Personal Privacy**: The right to bodily integrity and freedom from unwanted touching or observation.
    
- **Informational Privacy**: The right to control the gathering, use, and sharing of one's personal information.
    

Despite the intuitive importance of this right, its direct legal protection under the common law has been a slow and cautious process.

#### The Traditional Common Law Position: No General Tort of Privacy

The most important aspect of the general concept of privacy in common law is that, historically, there was **no single, standalone tort for "invasion of privacy."** A claimant could not simply go to court and sue because their privacy had been violated.

The courts were reluctant to create such a broad right for several reasons, including the difficulty of defining the scope of "privacy" and concerns about how it would clash with the equally important principle of freedom of expression.

#### The "Patchwork" of Indirect Protection

Instead of a single tort, the common law protected privacy interests indirectly through a "patchwork" of other existing legal actions. A claimant who felt their privacy was violated had to try to fit their claim into one of the following established categories:

- **Trespass to Land**: This could be used to sue someone who physically entered the claimant's property without permission, such as an intrusive photographer coming into a private garden. This protected _territorial privacy_.
    
- **Private Nuisance**: This could be used in cases of persistent harassment that affected the claimant's enjoyment of their land, such as repeated and unwanted telephone calls or intrusive surveillance from a neighbouring property.
    
- **Defamation**: This tort protects against the publication of _false_ statements that harm reputation. It indirectly protected privacy by providing a remedy against false gossip, but it was useless against the publication of _true_ but private information.
    
- **Breach of Confidence**: This equitable action was the most significant tool for protecting privacy. It could prevent the publication of private information (such as personal letters or medical details) that was shared in circumstances creating an obligation of confidence. This protected _informational privacy_.
    

Therefore, the general concept of privacy in traditional tort law is one of **fragmented and indirect protection**. This traditional position, based on English common law, represents the historical foundation of the law in **Bangladesh**. While the Constitution of Bangladesh protects privacy from state intrusion, private claims have historically relied on this patchwork of established legal actions. This background is essential for understanding the modern evolution of privacy law, which has been driven by the recognition of privacy as a fundamental human right.
