Of course. Let's cover the important and developing topic of Privacy.

### 7. Privacy ⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: This is a rapidly developing and highly relevant area of law, addressing the conflict between individual autonomy and public curiosity in the modern age. Understanding its foundations, especially its link to human rights, is crucial for a contemporary legal education. Modern technology and media have made the protection of privacy a central legal challenge. 📸

#### 1. General Concept (Subtopic 7.1)

The concept of privacy is often summarized by the famous phrase, "the right to be let alone." It encompasses several related ideas: the right to be free from physical intrusion into one's private space, the right to control the dissemination of one's personal information, and the right to live one's life free from unwarranted public scrutiny.

Historically, the common law of England (which **Bangladesh** follows) did **not** recognize a general, standalone tort for the "invasion of privacy." There was no single cause of action with this name. Instead, privacy interests were protected indirectly and imperfectly through a patchwork of other torts:

- **Trespass to Land**: Protected against physical intrusion into a person's home or land.
    
- **Private Nuisance**: Could protect against persistent harassment, such as unwanted telephone calls.
    
- **Defamation**: Protected against the publication of _false_ private information.
    
- **Breach of Confidence**: An equitable action that could protect _true_ private information that was shared in a confidential relationship (e.g., between a doctor and patient).

#### 2. General Principles (The Modern Tort) (Subtopic 7.2)

The legal protection for privacy has evolved significantly in recent decades, primarily due to the influence of human rights law. This led the UK courts to develop a new tort known as **Misuse of Private Information**. This is now the primary cause of action for what is commonly understood as invasion of privacy.

The principles of this new tort involve a **two-stage test**:

**Stage 1: Is there a "Reasonable Expectation of Privacy"?** The court first asks whether the claimant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to the information or activity in question. This is an objective test that considers all the circumstances, including:

- The nature of the information (e.g., medical, financial, and sexual information is highly private).
    
- The location of the activity (e.g., there is a higher expectation of privacy in a home than in a public street).
    
- The public profile of the claimant (public figures may have a lower expectation of privacy).
    

**Stage 2: The Balancing Act** If a reasonable expectation of privacy exists, the court must then conduct a balancing exercise between the claimant's right to privacy and the defendant's right to freedom of expression. This involves weighing the importance of two competing human rights:

- **Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)**: The right to respect for private and family life.
    
- **Article 10 of the ECHR**: The right to freedom of expression.
    

The court asks whether the public interest in publishing the information outweighs the individual's interest in keeping it private. The "public interest" is not simply what the public finds interesting; it relates to matters of legitimate public debate, such as exposing crime, hypocrisy, or matters affecting public health and safety.

A key case is **_Campbell v MGN Ltd (2004)_**, where a newspaper published photos of supermodel Naomi Campbell leaving a Narcotics Anonymous meeting. The court held that while the public had an interest in knowing she was a recovering addict (as she had previously denied it), publishing the details and photos of her therapy was a disproportionate intrusion into her private medical information. Her right to privacy (Article 8) outweighed the newspaper's freedom of expression (Article 10).

#### 3. Privacy as a Human Right (Subtopic 7.3)

The modern tort of privacy is fundamentally rooted in the recognition of privacy as a basic human right.

- **International Law**: The right to privacy is enshrined in major international treaties, including Article 12 of the **Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)** and Article 17 of the **International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)**.
    
- **The Constitution of Bangladesh**: The right to privacy is explicitly protected as a fundamental right in **Article 43 of the Constitution of Bangladesh**, which guarantees every citizen "the right ... to the privacy of his correspondence and other means of communication."
    
    - This constitutional right is primarily enforceable against the state. However, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh has also interpreted the **"right to life"** under **Article 32** expansively to include the right to live with dignity, which encompasses privacy.
        

While a distinct tort of "invasion of privacy" between private citizens has yet to be formally established by the courts in **Bangladesh** in the same way as in the UK, the strong constitutional protection provides a firm basis for its future development.
