Of course. Let's move to the general principles of modern privacy law.

### 7.2 General Principles ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: This subtopic explains the revolutionary shift in the legal protection of privacy. The principles discussed here, born from the influence of human rights law, form the basis of the modern tort of misuse of private information and the crucial balancing act between privacy and free speech. ⚖️

The general principles of privacy law have undergone a significant transformation. The traditional common law, with its indirect "patchwork" of protection, was considered inadequate for the modern world. The major change was driven by the recognition of privacy as a fundamental human right.

The modern principles, developed by courts in the UK and influential in Bangladesh, have created a new tort called **Misuse of Private Information**. This tort is governed by a two-stage test.

### Stage 1: Is There a "Reasonable Expectation of Privacy"?

Before a claim can even begin, the court must first determine if the information or activity in question is actually "private." The claimant must have a **reasonable expectation of privacy**. This is an objective test where the court considers all the circumstances, including:

- **The Nature of the Information**: Information relating to health, personal relationships, sexuality, and private finances will almost always attract a reasonable expectation of privacy.
    
- **The Claimant's Public Profile**: While public figures (like politicians or celebrities) have a reduced expectation of privacy concerning their public roles, they retain a right to privacy in aspects of their personal lives that are not relevant to their public function.
    
- **The Location**: There is a high expectation of privacy in one's home. In a public place, this expectation is much lower, but it is not entirely eliminated (e.g., a person may still have an expectation of privacy regarding a private conversation in a public park).
    

If there is no reasonable expectation of privacy, the claim fails.

### Stage 2: The Balancing Act

If a reasonable expectation of privacy is established, the court moves to the second stage. This is the core of modern privacy law: a **balancing exercise** between two competing fundamental rights:

1. **The Claimant's Right to Privacy**: The right to respect for one's private and family life.
    
2. **The Defendant's Right to Freedom of Expression**: The right of the press and the public to receive and impart information.
    

The court must weigh these two rights and decide which should prevail in the specific circumstances of the case. The central question is whether the **public interest** in publishing the information outweighs the individual's interest in keeping it private.

It is crucial to distinguish between what is in the **"public interest"** and what is merely **"interesting to the public."**

- **Public Interest**: This involves matters of legitimate public debate and concern, such as exposing crime, hypocrisy by public officials, correcting a misleading public image, or matters of public health and safety.
    
- **Interesting to the Public**: This refers to trivial gossip or intrusive details about a person's life that serve no real public purpose other than satisfying curiosity.
    

The key case is **_Campbell v MGN Ltd (2004)_**, where a newspaper published photos of model Naomi Campbell leaving a Narcotics Anonymous meeting. The court balanced the rights and found that while the public had an interest in knowing she was a recovering addict (to correct her prior false statements), publishing the specific details and photos of her therapy was a disproportionate intrusion. The interest in protecting the privacy of her medical treatment outweighed the public's right to know the specific details.

In **Bangladesh**, the Supreme Court engages in a similar balancing exercise between the fundamental right to privacy (**Article 43 of the Constitution**) and the right to freedom of speech and the press (**Article 39**).
