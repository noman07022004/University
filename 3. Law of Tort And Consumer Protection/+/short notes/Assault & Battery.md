In **tort law** and **criminal law**, **assault** and **battery** are often closely related, but they are legally distinct acts. Here’s a clear breakdown of the **differences**:

---

### 🔹 **Assault**

**Definition:**  
Assault is the act of **intentionally causing another person to apprehend (fear) immediate unlawful force or violence.**

**Key Elements:**

- No physical contact is necessary.
    
- The victim must **believe** that they are about to be harmed.
    
- Threats must be **immediate** and **possible** to carry out.
    

**Example:**  
If someone raises their fist and moves toward you as if to punch you — but doesn’t actually hit you — that’s assault.

### 🔹 **Battery**

**Definition:**  
Battery is the **intentional and unlawful physical contact** with another person **without consent**.

**Key Elements:**

- **Physical contact** is required.
    
- The contact must be **unlawful** (not consented to or justified).
    
- The force doesn’t have to be violent; even touching someone rudely or in anger can be battery.
    

**Example:**  
If someone actually punches you — even lightly — without justification, that’s battery.
