## 📘 **What is Common Law?**

### 🔹 Definition:

**Common law** is a system of law that is **developed by judges through court decisions**, rather than written in one single code or statute.

> It is called “common” because it was meant to be _common across all of England_ — and later spread to many former British colonies, including **Bangladesh**.

## 🔍 Key Features of Common Law

|Feature|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Judge-made law**|Laws are developed through **precedents** (past court decisions)|
|**Not codified**|Not written in a single act or statute — but grows case by case|
|**Binding precedent**|Lower courts must follow decisions of higher courts (stare decisis)|
|**Flexible & evolving**|It adapts over time as society changes|
|**Used in**|UK, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, USA, Canada, etc.|

## 🧾 Example:

If in 1932, a British court decides that a **manufacturer is liable for harm caused by a defective product** (like in **Donoghue v. Stevenson**), then courts in other common law countries may follow that principle — unless local law says otherwise.

> In tort law, **most principles** (like negligence, vicarious liability, nuisance, etc.) originally come from such **judge-made rules**, not statutes.

## ⚖️ Common Law in Bangladesh

Even after independence:

- Bangladesh **inherits the common law system** from British India.
    
- **Judges still apply English/Indian case law** when there’s no local statute.
    
- Statutes like the **Penal Code 1860**, **Contract Act 1872**, and **Evidence Act 1872** are also based on **common law reasoning**, though codified.
    

### 💡 Example in Bangladeshi Tort Law:

There is **no Tort Law Act** in Bangladesh. So:

- If someone sues for negligence,
    
- The court uses **common law rules** (e.g., duty of care, breach, causation),
    
- Often citing **UK or Indian cases** as guidance.
