## 💡 What Does "Interest" Mean in Tort Law?

In tort law, the word **"interest"** does **not** just mean being _connected_ to something or _liking_ something.

Instead, it means:

> **A legally protected right or benefit** that belongs to a person — something the law recognizes as worth protecting.

|---|---|
|**Personal Interests**|Your body, health, liberty, dignity, and reputation.|

|**Economic Interests**|Your right to earn income, do business, or be free from unfair competition.|
|**Privacy Interests**|Your personal information and private life being free from intrusion.|

### ❌ What It Does _Not_ Mean:

- **Just having a connection or emotional attachment** is not enough.
    
- The law protects **legal rights**, not just personal preferences.
    

---

### 📌 Simple Test:

Ask yourself:

> **“Do I have a legal right over this thing?”**  
> If yes — then **tort law may protect your interest** in it.

### 🧠 Example:

- You like your neighbor's garden — but you don’t own it.  
    ✅ You have **no legal interest** in it → **not protected**.
    
- You own a garden, and someone damages it.  
    ✅ You have a **legal interest** → **protected by tort law**.

### 📝 In Short:

> "Interest" in tort law means a **right or benefit that is legally recognized and protected**.  
> Tort law protects **interests** — not casual connections.
