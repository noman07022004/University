Of course. Let's cover the defenses for these economic torts.

### 8.4 Defenses ⭐⭐

> **Why Not as Critical**: The defenses for these torts are primarily a direct rebuttal of the elements the claimant must prove, rather than standalone legal concepts like 'privilege' or 'contributory negligence'. They are a necessary component of the analysis but are less complex than the defenses in other areas. 🚫

For the economic torts of deceit, malicious falsehood, and passing off, the most effective defense is often to demonstrate that the claimant has failed to prove one of the essential elements of the tort.

#### Defenses to Deceit (Fraud)

The essence of deceit is dishonesty. Therefore, the primary defense is to **negate the element of fraud**.

- **Honest Belief**: The defendant can escape all liability if they can prove that they had an **honest belief** in the truth of their statement. As established in _Derry v Peek_, even if the defendant's belief was foolish, careless, or unreasonable, as long as it was genuinely and honestly held, there is no fraud.
    

Other defenses include showing that:

- The statement was a mere statement of opinion, not fact.
    
- The claimant did not actually rely on the defendant's statement.

#### Defenses to Malicious Falsehood

The main defenses are aimed at disproving the core elements that the claimant is required to prove.

- **Lack of Malice**: The defendant can defeat the claim by showing that the statement was made in good faith and without any improper motive. If there is no malice, a key ingredient of the tort is missing.
    
- **Truth of the Statement**: If the defendant can prove that the statement published was, in fact, true, then it cannot be a malicious _falsehood_.

#### Defenses to Passing Off

Defenses to passing off focus on showing that the claimant has not established one of the three elements of the "classic trinity" (goodwill, misrepresentation, damage).

- **No Likelihood of Confusion**: This is a common defense. The defendant argues that their brand name, logo, or packaging is sufficiently distinct from the claimant's, and therefore the public is not likely to be confused or deceived.
    
- **Claimant Has No Goodwill**: The defendant may argue that the claimant has not established a sufficient reputation in the mark or name for it to be protected.
    
- **Mark is Merely Descriptive**: A defendant can argue that the word or feature the claimant is trying to protect is a generic or descriptive term for the product itself, and not a distinctive mark of the claimant's brand (e.g., trying to claim a monopoly on the word "Best" for a product).
    

In **Bangladesh**, these common law defenses are the standard arguments used in courts to rebut claims of deceit, malicious falsehood, and passing off.
