Of course. Let's cover the commercial tort of passing off.

### 8.3 Passing Off ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: This tort is the primary common law protection against brand piracy and unfair competition. It protects the valuable business asset of 'goodwill' and is fundamental to modern intellectual property and commercial law. üçã

#### Definition and Purpose

Passing off is a tort that protects a business's **goodwill** from being damaged by a competitor's misrepresentation. In simple terms, it prevents a trader from "passing off" their goods or services as though they were the goods or services of a more established competitor.

The tort does not protect a name or a logo in itself (that is the role of statutory trademark law); instead, it protects the **goodwill** associated with that name or logo. **Goodwill** is the attractive force that brings in customers‚Äîthe benefit and advantage of a good name, reputation, and business connections.

### The "Classic Trinity": The Elements of Passing Off

To succeed in a claim for passing off, a claimant must prove three essential elements, famously summarized as the "classic trinity" in the Jif Lemon case (_Reckitt & Colman v Borden_).

#### 1. Goodwill or Reputation

The claimant must prove that they have established a **reputation** in their brand, mark, or "get-up" (the overall appearance, including packaging, brand name, logos, and even distinctive shapes).

- **The Key Requirement**: The public must associate this distinctive mark or get-up with the claimant's specific goods or services. For example, the public associates the distinctive shape of a Coca-Cola bottle with the product made by that specific company.
    

#### 2. Misrepresentation

The claimant must prove that the defendant has made a **misrepresentation** (which can be intentional or unintentional) that is **likely to deceive** a substantial portion of the public into believing that the defendant's goods or services are in some way connected to the claimant.

- **The Test**: The question is whether an ordinary, average customer is likely to be confused. It does not matter that a very careful expert would not be fooled.
    
- **Example**: Selling a new brand of dark-coloured fizzy drink called "Koka-Kola" in a red and white can with a similar font would likely be a misrepresentation.
    

#### 3. Damage

The claimant must prove that the misrepresentation has caused, or is likely to cause, **actual damage** to their goodwill. This damage can take several forms:

- **Loss of Sales**: Customers buying the defendant's product under the mistaken belief that it is the claimant's.
    
- **Damage to Reputation**: If the defendant's product is of inferior quality, it can harm the reputation of the claimant's brand, with which it is being confused.
    
- **Dilution of Goodwill**: The use of a famous mark on an unrelated product can dilute the distinctiveness and value of the original brand.

### Passing Off in Bangladesh

Passing off is a crucial and frequently litigated tort in Bangladesh for the protection of business reputation. It operates alongside, but is distinct from, the statutory protection for registered trademarks under the **Trademarks Act, 2009**.

- **Key Difference**: An action for trademark infringement is for the violation of a **registered** mark. A passing off claim can be brought even if the name or logo is **unregistered**, as long as the claimant can prove they have established the necessary goodwill. In this way, passing off serves as the common law protection for unregistered trademarks.
