Of course. Let's start with the general concept of Deceit.

### 8.1 General Concept ⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: This subtopic introduces the tort of intentional fraudulent misrepresentation. Understanding the strict requirements for proving deceit is key to distinguishing it from mere negligence and appreciating the high bar the law sets for proving commercial fraud. 🤥

#### The Tort of Fraud

The general concept of the tort of **Deceit** is to provide a legal remedy for a person who suffers financial harm after relying on a statement that was made to them dishonestly. In simple terms, it is the tort of **fraud**.

The core of deceit is **dishonesty**. This is what distinguishes it from other torts related to false statements. While a person can be liable in the tort of negligence for a _carelessly_ made statement (negligent misstatement), a claim in deceit will only succeed if the claimant can prove the defendant was actually **fraudulent**.

#### The Essential Elements of Deceit

For a claim in deceit to succeed, the claimant must prove five distinct elements. These were famously established by the House of Lords in the case of **_Derry v Peek (1889)_**.

**1. A False Representation** The defendant must have made a false statement of **fact**. This does not include mere statements of opinion, advertising "puffs," or promises about the future.

**2. The Representation was made Fraudulently** This is the most critical element and the hardest to prove. A statement is considered fraudulent only if it is made:

- **(i) Knowingly** (the defendant knows it is untrue); OR
    
- **(ii) Without belief in its truth**; OR
    
- **(iii) Recklessly, careless as to whether it be true or false.**
    

Crucially, "recklessness" here means a high degree of carelessness that shows a disregard for the truth. Mere negligence or stupidity is not enough. If the defendant had an **honest belief** that their statement was true, however unreasonable that belief might be, they are not fraudulent.

**3. Intention for the Claimant to Act on it** The defendant must have intended for the claimant (or a group of people to which the claimant belongs) to rely and act on the false statement.

**4. The Claimant Relied on it** The claimant must prove that they were actually induced by the statement to act in a certain way. The false statement does not have to be the only reason they acted, but it must have been a material factor in their decision.

**5. The Claimant Suffered Damage** The claimant must prove that they suffered a loss, which is typically financial, as a direct result of their reliance on the fraudulent statement.

In **Bangladesh**, these common law principles from _Derry v Peek_ are the foundation of the tort of deceit. The concept of fraudulent misrepresentation is also a key element in the **Contract Act, 1872 (Section 17)**, which can allow a party to rescind a contract in addition to seeking damages in tort.
