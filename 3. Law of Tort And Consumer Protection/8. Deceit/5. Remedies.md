Of course. Let's cover the remedies for these economic torts.

### 8.5 Remedies ⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: Understanding the available remedies is key to appreciating the practical purpose of suing for these economic torts. The choice of remedy, particularly between damages and an injunction, directly affects the commercial outcome for the businesses involved. ⚖️

When a claimant is successful in a claim for deceit, malicious falsehood, or passing off, the court can award several remedies to compensate them and prevent future harm.

---

#### 1. Damages

Damages are a monetary award paid by the defendant to the claimant and are the primary remedy for compensating for financial loss.

- **In Deceit**: The aim is to put the claimant back in the position they were in before the fraudulent misrepresentation occurred. The claimant can recover for **all direct losses** flowing from the fraud, even if those losses were not foreseeable.
    
- **In Malicious Falsehood**: Damages are awarded to compensate for the **specific financial loss** (special damage) that the claimant proved was a direct result of the defendant's false statement.
    
- **In Passing Off**: Damages are calculated to compensate for the **damage to the claimant's goodwill**, which may include loss of sales and harm to their brand's reputation.

#### 2. Injunction

An injunction is a court order that commands the defendant to stop their wrongful conduct. This is a crucial and very common remedy in cases of malicious falsehood and passing off, as these often involve ongoing business activities.

While damages compensate for past harm, an **injunction prevents future harm** and protects the claimant's business interests going forward.

- **Examples**:
    
    - A court can issue an injunction to stop a company from using a confusingly similar brand name (in a passing off case).
        
    - A court can order a defendant to remove a maliciously false review from a website.

#### 3. Account of Profits

This is an equitable remedy that is an **alternative to damages**, most often used in passing off cases.

- **The Principle**: Instead of claiming for the loss they have suffered, the claimant can choose to demand that the defendant **surrenders all the profits** they have made as a result of their wrongful act (e.g., the profits from selling goods with the deceptive packaging).
    
- **Choice**: A claimant must choose between seeking damages (to compensate for their own loss) or an account of profits (to claim the defendant's gains). They cannot have both. This remedy can be particularly useful if the defendant made a large profit from their wrongdoing, which may be more than the loss the claimant can prove.
    

In **Bangladesh**, these remedies are all available to a successful claimant. The power to grant an **injunction** or order an **account of profits** is governed by the **Specific Relief Act, 1877**, while the power to award damages is inherent in the civil courts.
