Of course. Let's cover the main topic of Deceit and other related economic torts.

### 8. Deceit and Other Economic Torts ⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: These torts protect against different forms of dishonest commercial practice, safeguarding economic and business interests from fraud and misrepresentation. They are key components of commercial law and show how tort law operates beyond physical harm to protect financial assets like goodwill. வணிக

This area of tort law is primarily concerned with providing remedies for intentional, false statements that cause financial or business losses. The main torts are Deceit (also known as Fraud), Malicious Falsehood, and Passing Off.

#### 1. Deceit (Fraud) (Subtopic 8.1)

Deceit is the tort of **fraudulent misrepresentation**. It is committed when a defendant makes a statement they know to be false, intending for the claimant to act upon it, and the claimant does act upon it and suffers financial loss. This tort requires a high degree of fault—actual dishonesty.

To succeed in a claim for deceit, the claimant must prove five elements, famously set out in **_Derry v Peek (1889)_**:

1. **A False Representation**: The defendant made a false statement of fact.
    
2. **Fraudulent State of Mind**: The defendant made the statement **fraudulently**. This means they made it:
    
    - **Knowing it was false**; OR
        
    - **Without belief in its truth**; OR
        
    - **Recklessly, careless as to whether it was true or false.**
        
    - (Note: Mere carelessness or negligence is not enough for deceit; that falls under negligent misstatement).
        
3. **Intention to Induce**: The defendant intended for the claimant to rely on the statement.
    
4. **Reliance**: The claimant actually and reasonably relied on the statement.
    
5. **Damage**: The claimant suffered financial loss as a result.

#### 2. Malicious Falsehood (Subtopic 8.2)

This tort protects against false statements made maliciously about a claimant's business, property, or goods. It is sometimes called "trade libel."

- **Distinction from Defamation**: **Defamation** protects a person's _personal reputation_. **Malicious falsehood** protects their _economic or property interests_.
    
    - "Mr. X is a dishonest person" -> Defamation.
        
    - "Mr. X's restaurant uses expired ingredients" -> Malicious Falsehood.
        
- **Elements**:
    
    1. A **false statement** was published about the claimant's business or property.
        
    2. The statement was published with **malice** (i.e., knowing it was false or with an improper motive).
        
    3. The publication caused **special damage** (actual financial loss).

#### 3. Passing Off (Subtopic 8.3)

Passing off is a tort that protects the **goodwill** and business reputation of a trader from deceptive imitation. It prevents one business from misrepresenting its goods or services as being those of another, established business.

To succeed, a claimant must prove the "Classic Trinity":

1. **Goodwill or Reputation**: The claimant has established a reputation in their brand name, logo, packaging, or other features (the "get-up"). The public associates this get-up with the claimant.
    
2. **Misrepresentation**: The defendant has made a misrepresentation (intentionally or not) that is likely to deceive the public into believing their goods or services are the claimant's.
    
3. **Damage**: The claimant has suffered, or is likely to suffer, damage to their goodwill as a result (e.g., loss of sales or damage to their brand's reputation).

#### 4. Defenses (Subtopic 8.4)

- **For Deceit**: The primary defense is to show an **honest belief** in the truth of the statement. If the defendant was not dishonest, the claim fails.
    
- **For Malicious Falsehood**: The main defense is to disprove malice by showing the statement was made in **good faith**.
    
- **For Passing Off**: A common defense is to show there is **no likelihood of confusion** between the two products or that the claimant's "get-up" is merely descriptive and has not acquired a distinctive reputation.

#### 5. Remedies (Subtopic 8.5)

- **Damages**: This is the primary remedy to compensate for the financial loss suffered.
    
- **Injunction**: This is a crucial remedy, especially in passing off and malicious falsehood cases, to get a court order stopping the defendant from continuing the harmful misrepresentation.
    
- **Account of Profits**: An equitable remedy where the defendant must surrender the profits they made from their wrongful act (e.g., from selling counterfeit goods).
    

In **Bangladesh**, these common law torts are all recognized. **Passing Off** is particularly important in commercial litigation and often runs alongside claims for statutory trademark infringement under the **Trademarks Act, 2009**.
