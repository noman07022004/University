Of course. Let's cover the tort of malicious falsehood.

### 8.2 Malicious Falsehood ‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Not as Critical**: This is a less common tort than defamation or deceit. Its primary importance is in understanding the specific legal remedy available for false statements about a business or property that are made with malice but are not defamatory to personal reputation. üó£Ô∏è"

#### Definition and Purpose

Malicious falsehood is a tort committed by publishing a **false statement maliciously** about the claimant, their property, or their business, which causes them to suffer **actual financial loss**.

This tort fills a specific gap in the law. Sometimes a false statement can cause serious financial harm without being technically defamatory. For example, falsely claiming a company's products are unsafe might not damage the personal reputation of the company's owner, but it could destroy their business. Malicious falsehood provides a remedy for this kind of economic harm.

#### The Crucial Distinction: Malicious Falsehood vs. Defamation

Understanding malicious falsehood requires contrasting it clearly with defamation.

|Feature|**Defamation**|**Malicious Falsehood**|
|---|---|---|
|**Interest Protected**|**Personal Reputation**|**Economic Interests** (in business, goods, property)|
|**Example Statement**|"The chef is a convicted criminal."|"The chef's food will give you food poisoning."|
|**Burden of Proof**|The claimant proves publication. The **defendant** must prove the statement was true.|The **claimant** must prove the statement was false, made with malice, and caused damage.|
|**Damage Required?**|Libel is actionable _per se_ (damage is presumed).|Generally, the claimant must prove **special damage** (actual financial loss).|

#### The Elements of Malicious Falsehood

To succeed in a claim, the claimant must prove three things:

**1. The Statement was False** Unlike in defamation, the burden is on the claimant to prove that the defendant's statement was untrue.

**2. The Statement was made with Malice** This is a key ingredient. "Malice" means the defendant knew the statement was false, was reckless as to whether it was true, or published it for some improper motive (e.g., a deliberate intention to harm the claimant's business).

**3. The Statement Caused Special Damage** The claimant must generally prove that the publication of the false statement caused them to suffer a specific, identifiable financial loss. For example, they must show that they lost a particular customer or contract as a direct result of the statement.

In **Bangladesh**, malicious falsehood is recognized as a tort under the principles of common law, providing a remedy for individuals or businesses who have suffered financial loss due to deliberate and untrue statements made about their economic interests.
