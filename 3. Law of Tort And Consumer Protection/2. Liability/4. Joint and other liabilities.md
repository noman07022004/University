## 📑 **2.4 Joint and Other Liabilities**

---

### **📌 Introduction**

Sometimes, **more than one person** is legally responsible for a single tort.  
**Joint liability** ensures that the injured party can recover full compensation, even if there were **multiple wrongdoers**.

This protects victims and makes sure wrongdoers can’t escape by blaming each other.

---

### **📜 Definition**

**Joint Liability:**  
When **two or more persons** are held **equally responsible** for the same tortious act — each is liable for the **whole damage**, not just their share.

---

### **📌 Why Joint Liability Exists**

✔ Victims shouldn’t suffer because it’s hard to separate who did what.  
✔ Encourages co-defendants to sort out contribution among themselves.  
✔ Prevents a tortfeasor from escaping liability if co-wrongdoers are missing or insolvent.

### **🔑 Types of Joint & Other Liabilities**

---

### **1️⃣ Joint Tortfeasors**

- People who act **together** to commit a tort, e.g., conspirators.
    
- Example: Two people publish a defamatory statement together — both are jointly liable.
    

---

### **2️⃣ Independent but Concurrent Tortfeasors**

- When two or more wrongdoers act **independently**, but their acts combine to cause a single harm.
    
- Example: Two cars negligently collide and injure a pedestrian — both drivers may be jointly and severally liable.
    

---

### **3️⃣ Several Liability**

- Each tortfeasor is liable for the full damage, but the plaintiff can recover from any one.
    
- The paying tortfeasor can seek **contribution** from the others.
    

---

### **📌 Important Doctrines**

---

### ✅ **Contribution**

- One wrongdoer who pays more than their share can claim **contribution** from co-wrongdoers.
    

**Example:**  
A and B jointly defame C. C sues A and recovers all damages. A can claim half from B.

---

### ✅ **Release and Accord**

- Releasing one joint tortfeasor can sometimes release all — so courts look carefully at settlements.
    

---

### **📌 Relevant Case**

**Koursk Case (1924)** — Two ships collided causing damage to a third ship. Both were held jointly liable.
