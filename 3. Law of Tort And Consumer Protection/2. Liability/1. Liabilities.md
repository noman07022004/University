---

### **📌 Introduction**

**Liability** in tort law means a person’s **legal responsibility** to compensate for harm caused by their wrongful act or omission.  
There are **different forms of liability**, depending on **fault, relationship, or the nature of the act**.

Understanding the **types of liability** is key to knowing **who can be held responsible and when**.

### **🔑 Main Types of Liability**

---

### **1️⃣ Fault-Based Liability**

- Most torts are based on **fault** — the wrongdoer must be **at fault** (intentional or negligent).
    
- If there is **no fault**, there is usually **no liability**.
    

**Example:**  
A driver causes an accident by careless driving — liable for negligence.

---

### **2️⃣ Strict Liability**

- Sometimes, a person can be liable **even without fault** — this is called **strict liability**.
    
- The rule comes from the famous case **Rylands v Fletcher (1868)**.
    
- If a person keeps **dangerous things** on their land, and they escape and cause harm, the owner is liable.
    

**Example:**  
A factory stores toxic chemicals. If they leak and damage neighbours’ crops, the factory is liable — even if it took all reasonable care.

---

### **3️⃣ Absolute Liability**

- In India and Bangladesh, the **Bhopal Gas Tragedy** showed that for **ultra-hazardous activities**, there can be **absolute liability**.
    
- **Absolute liability** is stricter than strict liability — **no exceptions, no defenses**.
    

**Example:**  
Industries dealing with hazardous substances must fully compensate victims if accidents occur — even if not at fault.

---

### **4️⃣ Vicarious Liability (Covered in 2.2)**

- Sometimes, a person is liable for **acts done by others** — for example, employers for employees.
    
- This is called **vicarious liability** and will be explained in detail in the next subtopic.
