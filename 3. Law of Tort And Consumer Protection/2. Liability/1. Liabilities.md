Of course. Here is a detailed explanation of the different forms of liability.

### 2.1 Liabilities ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: This subtopic explains the fundamental philosophical bases upon which legal responsibility is built. Understanding the distinction between fault-based, strict, and absolute liability is essential for comprehending the rationale behind different torts and for analyzing the evolving principles of the legal system.

In the law of tort, "liability" signifies the legal obligation or responsibility of a person to provide a remedy for a wrong they have caused. This responsibility is not always founded on the same principle. The basis for imposing liability can be broadly categorized into three distinct types.

### 1. Fault-Based Liability

This is the most common and intuitive basis for liability in modern tort law. It rests on the principle that a person should only be held responsible for harm that results from their blameworthy or wrongful conduct. This "fault" can manifest in two primary ways:

- **Intention**: This applies to acts where the defendant desired to bring about the consequences or knew with substantial certainty that the consequences would result. It is the basis for **intentional torts** like battery, trespass, and deceit. The defendant is at fault because they acted with a wrongful state of mind.
    
- **Negligence**: This is the most prevalent form of fault. It does not involve any intention to cause harm. Instead, the fault lies in the defendant's carelessness—their failure to act with the level of care that a "reasonably prudent person" would have exercised in the same circumstances. The defendant is considered at fault for falling below an objective standard of conduct.
    

The core idea of fault-based liability is rooted in a moral conception of justice: liability should be tied to blameworthiness.

### 2. Strict Liability

Strict liability is a significant exception to the fault-based principle. Here, liability is imposed **without fault** (_sine culpa_). The plaintiff does not need to prove that the defendant acted intentionally or negligently. Liability is established simply by proving that the defendant's actions caused the harm.

**Rationale**: The law imposes strict liability in situations where a person's activities, while not necessarily unlawful, pose an extraordinary risk to the community. The rationale includes:

- The person who creates the high risk and benefits from it should bear the burden of any resulting losses.
    
- It encourages a higher standard of care for dangerous activities.
    
- It eases the plaintiff's burden of proof in complex cases where proving negligence might be difficult.
    

**The Landmark Example: The Rule in _Rylands v Fletcher_** The classic doctrine of strict liability comes from this case. The rule states that a person who, for their own purposes, brings onto their land and keeps there anything **likely to do mischief if it escapes**, must keep it in at their peril. If it does escape, they are _prima facie_ liable for all the damage that is the natural consequence of the escape.

**Key Distinction**: Unlike absolute liability, a defendant in a strict liability case can raise certain specific defenses, such as:

- Act of God
    
- Act of a third party
    
- The plaintiff's own fault or consent
    
- Statutory authority

### 3. Absolute Liability

This is the most stringent form of liability. It is a radical version of strict liability where the defendant is held responsible for the resulting harm **without being able to access any defenses**.

**Origin and Rationale**: This principle was a judicial innovation of the Supreme Court of India in the landmark case of **_M.C. Mehta v. Union of India (1987)_**, following a deadly gas leak from a factory in Delhi. The Court held that the old rule of _Rylands v Fletcher_ was inadequate to deal with the hazards of modern industrial society.

The Court established that an enterprise engaged in a **"hazardous or inherently dangerous activity"** owes an **absolute and non-delegable duty** to the community. If any harm results from that activity, the enterprise is absolutely liable to compensate the victims, and the traditional defenses available under strict liability are not applicable. The Court reasoned that the enterprise has a social obligation to ensure safety and is best placed to absorb the cost of accidents.

**Bangladeshi Relevance**: The principle of absolute liability, originating from a neighbouring common law jurisdiction facing similar industrial challenges, holds significant persuasive value in Bangladesh. It represents a progressive judicial approach to industrial hazards and environmental torts.

|Type of Liability|Basis of Responsibility|Mental Element Required|Defenses Available|Classic Example|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Fault-Based**|Blameworthiness|Yes (Intention or Negligence)|All general defenses|Negligence, Trespass|
|**Strict**|Creation of extraordinary risk|No (Fault is irrelevant)|Limited specific defenses|Rule in _Rylands v Fletcher_|
|**Absolute**|Engaging in hazardous activity|No (Fault is irrelevant)|None|Principle from _M.C. Mehta_|
