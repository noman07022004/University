Of course. Let's proceed to the next subtopic on liability for animals.

### 2.3 Liability for Animals ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: This is a classic and distinct area of strict liability. Understanding these specific rules is necessary for solving problems involving harm caused by animals, a scenario that frequently appears in introductory tort law courses. üêæ

The law has long recognized that animals, due to their capacity for independent action, can pose a danger to people and property. As a result, special rules have been developed to govern liability for the harm they cause. A person can be held liable for damage caused by an animal in three primary ways.

### 1. The _Scienter_ Action (Strict Liability)

This is a form of strict liability based on the keeper's **knowledge** (in Latin, _scienter_) of the animal's dangerous nature. The common law divides animals into two categories for this purpose.

#### A) Animals _Ferae Naturae_ (Wild Animals)

These are animals that belong to a species which is inherently dangerous and not domesticated in the region. The species itself is considered wild and untamed.

- **Examples**: Lions, tigers, bears, monkeys, venomous snakes.
    
- **The Rule**: The keeper of an animal _ferae naturae_ is **strictly liable** for any harm it causes. The law **presumes** the keeper's knowledge of its dangerousness. The plaintiff does not have to prove the keeper was negligent or that the specific animal was vicious. The act of keeping a wild animal is done at the keeper's own peril.
    
- **Case Law**: In **_Behrens v Bertram Mills Circus (1957)_**, a circus elephant (which is legally classified as _ferae naturae_ regardless of training) was startled and injured the plaintiffs. The circus was held strictly liable, as the animal's wild nature meant liability was automatic once it caused harm.
    

#### B) Animals _Mansuetae Naturae_ (Tame Animals)

These are animals belonging to a species that is generally considered harmless or is domesticated, such as dogs, cats, horses, and cows.

- **The Rule**: The keeper is **not** automatically strictly liable. To succeed in a _scienter_ action, the plaintiff must prove that:
    
    1. The specific animal had a vicious or mischievous propensity that is not common to the species.
        
    2. The keeper had **actual knowledge** (_scienter_) of that specific propensity.
        
- **Proving Knowledge**: The burden of proof is on the plaintiff. For example, to hold an owner liable for a dog bite under this rule, the plaintiff must show that the owner knew this particular dog was prone to biting (e.g., it had attacked someone before, or the owner had warned others of its nature). This is the origin of the common misconception that "every dog gets one free bite."

### 2. Cattle Trespass

This is an ancient and distinct form of strict liability.

- **The Rule**: The keeper of livestock (including cattle, horses, sheep, pigs, and poultry) is **strictly liable** for any reasonably foreseeable damage caused when their animals unlawfully stray onto another person's land.
    
- **Rationale**: The fundamental principle is that a person has a duty to fence their animals _in_, not that their neighbour has a duty to fence them _out_. Liability is for damage to the land itself and for any consequential losses.

### 3. Negligence

Separate from the strict liability rules, a keeper of any animal can always be held liable for damage under the ordinary principles of **negligence**.

- **The Rule**: This action is based on fault. The plaintiff must prove that the keeper owed them a duty of care, breached that duty by failing to exercise reasonable control over the animal, and this breach caused foreseeable harm.
    
- **Example**: An owner who allows their large, energetic dog to run off-leash in a crowded area could be liable in negligence if the dog foreseeably knocks over and injures a person, even if the dog has never been vicious before. The fault lies not in the dog's nature, but in the owner's failure to take reasonable care.
    

In **Bangladesh**, these English common law principles‚Äîthe _scienter_ action, cattle trespass, and negligence‚Äîcontinue to form the basis of the law governing liability for animals.
