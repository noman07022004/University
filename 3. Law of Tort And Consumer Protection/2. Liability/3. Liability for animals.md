## 📑 **2.2 Vicarious Liability**

---

### **📌 Introduction**

**Vicarious liability** means **one person is held legally responsible for the wrongful acts of another** — even if the first person did not personally commit the tort.

This rule mainly applies in **employment relationships**, where **employers are liable for the acts of their employees** done _in the course of employment_.

### **📜 Definition**

**Vicarious Liability:**  
A legal principle where a person (like an employer) is **liable for the torts committed by another person (like an employee)** while doing their job.

---

### **📌 Rationale**

✔ Ensures victims get compensation from someone who can pay.  
✔ Encourages employers to supervise staff properly.  
✔ Reflects that employers benefit from employees’ work — so they share the risks.

### **🔑 Essentials of Vicarious Liability**

---

### **1️⃣ Relationship of Control**

- There must be a **master-servant (employer-employee) relationship**.
    
- Employers are not usually vicariously liable for **independent contractors**.
    

---

### **2️⃣ Wrongful Act Must Be Done in Course of Employment**

- The wrongful act must be **connected to the employee’s duties**.
    
- If an employee acts **entirely on a personal mission**, the employer may not be liable.
    

---

**Example:**  
✔ **Liable:** A bus driver negligently hits someone while driving passengers — employer is liable.  
✖ **Not liable:** If the bus driver uses the bus secretly for a personal trip and causes an accident.

---

### **3️⃣ Acts Authorised or Closely Connected**

- Employers are liable not just for authorised acts but also for **unauthorised ways of doing authorised acts**.
    

**Example:**  
A delivery driver assaults someone while delivering goods — if the assault was closely connected to his duties, the employer may still be liable.

### **📌 Important Case Laws**

✔ **Sitaram Motilal Kalal v Santanuprasad (AIR 1966 SC 1697)** — Employer was held liable for driver’s negligence.  
✔ **State of Rajasthan v Vidyawati (AIR 1962 SC 933)** — Govt liable for negligence of driver of a govt jeep.
