Of course. Let's cover the defenses available in a trespass claim.

### 4.4 Defenses to Trespass ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: In many trespass scenarios, the interference is obvious; the core legal dispute is whether the defendant's actions were justified. A successful defense provides a complete answer to the claim, making this a critical area for analyzing the outcome of a case. ⚖️

Even if a claimant proves that the defendant committed a direct and intentional act of interference, the defendant will not be liable if they can establish a valid legal justification for their actions. These justifications are known as defenses.

### 1. Consent (_Volenti non fit injuria_)

This is the most common and significant defense to trespass. If a person voluntarily consents to an act that would otherwise be a trespass, no tort is committed. The consent negates the wrongfulness of the defendant's conduct. Consent can be **express** (stated verbally or in writing) or **implied** from conduct.

- **In Trespass to Person**:
    
    - **Medical Treatment**: A patient gives express consent to a surgeon to be touched, which prevents the surgery from being a battery. However, the consent must be **real and informed**, meaning the patient must be told the broad nature of the procedure. A doctor who operates beyond the scope of the given consent may be liable for battery.
        
    - **Sporting Events**: Participants in contact sports like football or boxing give implied consent to physical contact that occurs within the ordinary rules of the game. They do not consent to violence that is clearly outside the rules.
        
    - **Everyday Life**: People are deemed to give implied consent to the normal, non-hostile touching that is a part of daily life, such as jostling in a crowded place.
        
- **In Trespass to Land**: A person who has permission, or a **license**, to enter land is not a trespasser. This is consent.

### 2. Lawful Authority

A defendant is not liable if their act of trespass is authorized by law. The interference must be carried out within the limits of the legal authority granted.

- **Examples**:
    
    - A **police officer** making a lawful arrest is not committing false imprisonment.
        
    - An official entering a property with a valid **search warrant** is not committing a trespass to land.
        
    - **Parental authority** allows a parent to exercise reasonable physical restraint or discipline over their child.

### 3. Necessity

This defense applies when the defendant commits a trespass to prevent a greater harm from occurring. The action must have been necessary and reasonable in all the circumstances.

- **Public Necessity**: This involves trespassing to protect the public interest. For example, a firefighter may damage a private house to create a firebreak to save a town from a spreading fire. This is a complete defense.
    
- **Private Necessity**: This involves trespassing to protect a private interest. For example, in **_Vincent v Lake Erie Transportation Co._**, a ship captain was justified in keeping his ship moored to the claimant's dock during a violent storm to save the ship. However, while the trespass was justified by necessity, the defendant was still required to pay for the damage caused to the dock.

### 4. Private Defense

The law allows a person to use **reasonable force** to defend themselves, another person, or their property from an imminent threat.

- **The Key Requirement is Proportionality**: The force used must be reasonable and proportionate to the threat posed. You cannot use deadly force to defend against a minor trespass to property. The threat must be current and active. For example, you can use reasonable force to push an attacker away (self-defense) or to remove a trespasser from your land, but you cannot use force to retaliate after the threat has passed.
    

These common law defenses are all recognized and applied by the courts in **Bangladesh** to determine whether an act of trespass was legally justified.
