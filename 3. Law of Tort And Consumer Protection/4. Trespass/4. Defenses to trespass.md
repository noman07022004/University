## 📑 **4.4 Defences to Trespass**

---

### 📌 **Introduction**

Although **trespass is actionable per se** (meaning the act itself is enough to sue), the defendant can **escape liability** if they prove a **valid defence**.

Defences show that the interference was **lawful** or **excusable** under the circumstances.

### 📌 **Common Defences to Trespass**

---

### ✅ **1️⃣ Consent**

- If the claimant **gave permission** for the act, it is not trespass.
    
    - Example: You invite a friend into your house — no trespass until they overstay or refuse to leave.
        

---

### ✅ **2️⃣ Necessity**

- Doing an act to **prevent greater harm** can justify trespass.
    
    - Example: Breaking into someone’s land to fight a fire or save a life.
        
    - _Southwark London Borough Council v Williams_ (1971) — necessity is very narrow and must be proportionate.
        

---

### ✅ **3️⃣ Self-Defence / Defence of Property**

- Using reasonable force to protect oneself or property.
    
    - Example: Pushing away a trespasser trying to assault you.
        
    - The force must be **reasonable and proportionate**.
        

---

### ✅ **4️⃣ Statutory Authority**

- Some trespasses are **authorized by law**.
    
    - Example: Police entering property with a valid search warrant.
        

---

### ✅ **5️⃣ Licence**

- A **licence** is permission given by the occupier to enter land.
    
    - Example: Shoppers in a store have implied licence to enter.
        
    - Exceeds scope → becomes trespass again (e.g., if you refuse to leave when asked).
        

---

### ✅ **6️⃣ Act of God**

- In rare cases, an unavoidable natural event may excuse trespass.
    
    - Example: A tree from your land is blown onto neighbour’s land during an extreme storm.

### 📌 **Limits on Defences**

✔ The act must be within the scope of the defence.  
✔ Using **excessive force** cancels the defence.  
✔ Consent or licence can be revoked — staying after revocation is trespass.

---

### 📌 **Relevant Case**

- _Hemming v Stoke Poges Golf Club_ (1920) — a golf ball landing on neighbour’s land during normal play may be justified if reasonable precautions are taken.

---

### 📌 **Tip**

✔ Always link the defence to a specific situation.  
✔ State that defences must be **reasonable**.  
✔ Use examples or short cases.

---

### ✏️ **Key Takeaway**

✔ Trespass defences excuse what would otherwise be wrongful interference.  
✔ Common defences: **consent, necessity, self-defence, statutory authority, licence**.  
✔ The burden is on the defendant to prove the defence.
