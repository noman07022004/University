Of course. Let's cover the remedies for trespass.

### 4.5 Remedies for Trespass ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: Understanding the available remedies is essential to grasping the practical purpose of a trespass claim. The remedy is the legal solution to the wrong, and knowing which remedies are available‚Äîparticularly the distinction between damages and injunctions‚Äîis key to analyzing the outcome of a legal dispute. üèÜ

Once a trespass has been established and no valid defense is available, the court will award a successful claimant a remedy. There are three main types of remedies for trespass.

### 1. Damages

Damages are a monetary award paid by the defendant to the claimant. Because trespass is **actionable _per se_**, a claimant is entitled to damages even if they have suffered no actual harm. The types of damages include:

- **Nominal Damages**: A small, symbolic sum awarded to a claimant who has not suffered any actual loss. The purpose of nominal damages is not to compensate, but to **vindicate the claimant's rights** and to formally declare that a trespass occurred.
    
- **Compensatory Damages**: If the trespass caused actual harm (e.g., a physical injury from a battery or damage to property), the claimant will be awarded compensatory damages to restore them to the position they were in before the tort.
    
- **Aggravated Damages**: These may be awarded to compensate the claimant for injury to their feelings, dignity, and pride caused by the insulting or high-handed manner of the trespass.
    
- **Exemplary (Punitive) Damages**: In exceptional cases where the defendant's conduct was outrageous or oppressive, the court may award exemplary damages. Their purpose is not to compensate the claimant but to **punish** the defendant and deter similar conduct.

### 2. Injunction

An injunction is a court order compelling a defendant to either do a specific act (a mandatory injunction) or, more commonly, to refrain from doing a specific act (a prohibitory injunction).

This is a particularly powerful and common remedy for trespass to land, especially where the trespass is **continuing or threatened**.

- **Example**: If a person repeatedly uses their neighbour's land as a shortcut, the neighbour can obtain a prohibitory injunction to order them to stop.
    
- **Example**: If a company has built a structure that overhangs the claimant's property, the claimant could seek a mandatory injunction ordering the company to remove it.
    

As an equitable remedy, an injunction is granted at the court's discretion and is typically awarded when damages are not an adequate remedy.

### 3. Self-Help (Extra-Judicial Remedy)

The law permits a person to take certain reasonable steps on their own, without going to court, to remedy a trespass. This is known as "self-help."

- **Caution**: The force used in self-help must always be **reasonable and proportionate** to the threat. Using excessive force can result in the person exercising self-help being held liable for a tort themselves.
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - **Ejection of a Trespasser**: A person in possession of land may use reasonable force to remove a trespasser, but only after first requesting that the trespasser leave.
        
    - **Self-Defense**: A person may use reasonable force to protect themselves from an imminent assault or battery.
        
    - **Recaption of Goods**: A person whose goods have been wrongfully taken may, in certain situations, lawfully retake them.
        

In **Bangladesh**, all three remedies‚Äîdamages, injunctions, and the right to reasonable self-help‚Äîare recognized. The remedy of injunction is particularly important for protecting property rights and is governed by the **Specific Relief Act, 1877**.
