## 📑 **4.5 Remedies for Trespass**

---

### 📌 **Introduction**

When trespass occurs, the law provides **remedies** to protect the claimant’s rights and compensate for the interference.  
Trespass is actionable **without proof of actual damage** — but remedies can vary based on what happened.

---

### 📌 **Main Remedies**

---

### ✅ **1️⃣ Damages**

- **Ordinary (Compensatory) Damages:**  
    Money to compensate for loss or harm — even if no actual damage, nominal damages may be awarded.
    
- **Aggravated Damages:**  
    If the trespass involved insult, malice, or oppressive conduct.  
    _Example:_ Trespass with threat or humiliation.
    
- **Exemplary (Punitive) Damages:**  
    Rare — awarded to punish the wrongdoer for outrageous conduct (e.g., deliberate, high-handed trespass).
    

---

### ✅ **2️⃣ Injunction**

- A court order to **stop continuing or future trespass**.
    
    - Example: Stopping a neighbour from repeatedly entering your land.
        
- Can be **mandatory** (ordering removal of a structure built in trespass) or **prohibitory** (preventing further entry).

### ✅ **3️⃣ Self-Help (Ejection)**

- The occupier can use **reasonable force** to remove a trespasser.
    
    - Example: A shopkeeper asks an unwelcome customer to leave and physically removes them if they refuse — but must not use excessive force.

### ✅ **4️⃣ Recovery of Possession**

- A person wrongfully dispossessed of land or goods may sue to **recover possession**.
    
    - Example: Action for **ejectment** or **replevin** (for goods).

### 📌 **Important Points**

✔ Even trivial trespass can get **nominal damages** — to affirm legal rights.  
✔ Damages and injunctions can be combined.  
✔ Self-help must be **immediate and reasonable** — excessive force can lead to liability.

### 📌 **Relevant Case**

- _Entick v Carrington_ (1765): Damages were awarded for unlawful entry by government officials.
    
- _Hemings v Stoke Poges Golf Club_ (1920): Nominal damages for minor, accidental trespass.

### 📌 **Tip**

✔ Always name at least 3 remedies: **damages, injunction, self-help**.  
✔ Give a clear example for each.  
✔ Mention that **trespass is actionable per se**, so nominal damages are common.

---

### ✏️ **Key Takeaway**

✔ Trespass remedies aim to **compensate**, **stop repetition**, and **protect rights**.  
✔ Courts can award ordinary, aggravated, or exemplary damages.  
✔ Injunctions prevent or stop future harm.
