Of course. Let's move on to the next main topic, Trespass.

### 4. Trespass ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: Trespass is one of the oldest and most fundamental torts, protecting core interests in personal safety, liberty, and property rights. Understanding its direct, intentional nature and the fact that it's actionable _per se_ is crucial for distinguishing it from indirect torts like negligence or nuisance. 🚫

#### 1. Definition and Core Concepts of Trespass (Subtopic 4.1)

Trespass is a tort that involves the **direct and intentional** interference with the person, land, or goods of another. This definition contains three essential elements that distinguish trespass from other torts:

1. **Intentional Act**: The defendant's action that constitutes the interference must be voluntary and intentional. It is not necessary for the defendant to have intended to cause harm or to have a wrongful motive; it is sufficient that they intended the act itself. For example, a person who intentionally walks onto land, honestly believing it is their own, has still committed an intentional act for the purpose of trespass.
    
2. **Direct Interference**: The interference must be a direct and immediate consequence of the defendant's act. There must be no significant intervening cause. The classic example is throwing a log onto a highway: if the log hits someone as it falls, it is a **direct** interference and a trespass. If the log lands on the road and a person later trips over it, the interference is **indirect** or consequential, and the claim would be in negligence, not trespass.
    
3. **Actionable _Per Se_**: This is a defining feature of trespass. It means the tort is actionable **without proof of damage**. The legal wrong is the interference with the claimant's rights itself. The claimant does not need to prove they suffered any loss or harm to succeed in their claim. This is an application of the maxim _injuria sine damno_ (legal injury without actual damage).

#### 2. Forms of Trespass (Subtopic 4.2)

Trespass is traditionally divided into three distinct forms, each protecting a different interest.

**A. Trespass to the Person** This protects an individual's right to bodily integrity and personal freedom. It has three sub-forms:

- **Battery**: The **intentional and direct application of unlawful force** to another person. Any physical contact, no matter how slight, can constitute force if it is done without consent or lawful justification (e.g., an unwanted touch, spitting).
    
- **Assault**: An **intentional act that causes the claimant to reasonably apprehend the imminent infliction of a battery**. The key is the _apprehension_ of immediate unlawful contact, not the contact itself. Pointing a weapon at someone is an assault; a threat of future violence is not.
    
- **False Imprisonment**: The **intentional and complete deprivation of a person's liberty** without lawful justification. The restraint must be total; if the claimant has a reasonable means of escape, there is no false imprisonment.
    

**B. Trespass to Land** This protects a person's right to the exclusive possession of their land. It is defined as the **intentional and direct interference with land in the possession of another**. This can occur in three ways:

- **Entering** upon the claimant's land.
    
- **Remaining** on the land after one's right to be there has been revoked.
    
- **Placing or projecting** any object onto the land.
    

"Land" includes the soil, structures on it, and the airspace above and ground beneath to the extent necessary for the ordinary use and enjoyment of the land.

**C. Trespass to Goods** This protects a person's interest in their movable property (chattels). It is the **intentional and direct interference with goods in the possession of another**, such as by taking, moving, or damaging them.

#### 3. Title of Claimant (Who Can Sue?) (Subtopic 4.3)

To bring a claim in trespass, the claimant must have a specific interest in the thing being protected.

- **Trespass to Person**: The individual who was the subject of the battery, assault, or false imprisonment is the proper claimant.
    
- **Trespass to Land**: The claimant must have **exclusive possession** of the land at the time of the trespass. This means a tenant in possession, not the landlord (owner), has the right to sue for trespass.
    
- **Trespass to Goods**: The claimant must be in **possession** of the goods at the time of the interference.

#### 4. Defenses to Trespass (Subtopic 4.4)

A defendant may escape liability by proving a valid defense. The most common defenses are:

- **Consent (_Volenti non fit injuria_)**: The most important defense. If the claimant consented to the act, there is no trespass (e.g., players in a contact sport consent to physical contact within the rules of the game; a patient consents to surgery).
    
- **Lawful Authority**: The defendant was acting under legal authority (e.g., a police officer making a lawful arrest).
    
- **Necessity**: The trespass was committed to prevent a greater harm (e.g., entering land to fight a fire).
    
- **Private Defense**: The defendant used reasonable force to defend themselves, their property, or another person.

#### 5. Remedies for Trespass (Subtopic 4.5)

A successful claimant can obtain several remedies:

- **Damages**: As trespass is actionable _per se_, a claimant is entitled to **nominal damages** even if no harm occurred. If actual harm was caused, they can recover **compensatory damages**. In egregious cases, **exemplary damages** may be awarded to punish the defendant.
    
- **Injunction**: A court order to prevent a threatened or continuing trespass. This is a particularly common and effective remedy for trespass to land.
    
- **Self-Help**: A person may use reasonable force to eject a trespasser from their land or to defend themselves from a battery.
    

In **Bangladesh**, the entire law of trespass is uncodified and is based on these English common law principles, which are applied by the courts through judicial precedent.
