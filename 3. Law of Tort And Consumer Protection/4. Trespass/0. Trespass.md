### 📌 **Bigger Picture: Trespass**

**What is Trespass?**

- **Trespass** is one of the oldest torts. It protects your **direct, immediate rights to personal security and property**.
    
- The classic forms are:
    
    - **Trespass to Person** (e.g., assault, battery, false imprisonment)
        
    - **Trespass to Land** (e.g., unlawful entry)
        
    - **Trespass to Goods** (unlawful interference with someone’s property)

### 📌 **Key Features**

✔️ Trespass is actionable **per se** — the claimant doesn’t have to prove damage, only the wrongful act.  
✔️ It protects your **right to enjoy your body, land, and goods without interference**.  
✔️ Unlike negligence, trespass usually involves **intentional or direct actions**.  
✔️ Common defences include consent, lawful authority, or necessity.

**Example:** If someone walks into your house without permission — that’s trespass.  
If someone hits you — that’s battery (a form of trespass to person).

**Why important?**  
✔️ Trespass protects your **fundamental civil rights** — your body, property, and freedom.  
✔️ It’s the root of many modern rights-based claims, and connects to constitutional and human rights law too.

**Bangladesh context:**  
✔️ Bangladesh follows the common law principles for trespass, with influences from the Indian Penal Code (for criminal aspects) and local civil rules for civil trespass.  
✔️ For example, unlawful entry onto land is both a tort and can be a criminal offence under penal provisions.
