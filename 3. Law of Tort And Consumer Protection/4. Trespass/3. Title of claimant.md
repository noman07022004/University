Of course. Let's examine the necessary standing a claimant must have to sue in trespass.

### 4.3 Title of Claimant ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: This subtopic addresses the critical procedural question of who has the legal standing (_locus standi_) to sue. While the interference is the wrongful act, the law requires the claimant to have a specific legal interest to bring a claim, and this interest differs for each form of trespass. üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

"Title" in this context refers to the legal interest or standing a person must have to bring a lawsuit for trespass. A claimant cannot sue simply because they were offended by the defendant's act; they must have the legally recognized interest that the specific form of trespass is designed to protect.

### 1. Title for Trespass to the Person

This is the most straightforward. The right to be free from battery, assault, and false imprisonment is a personal right that belongs to each individual.

- **Who can sue?** The proper claimant is the **individual whose bodily integrity or freedom of movement has been directly violated**.
    

A third party cannot sue for a trespass committed against another person (though they may have a separate claim if they, for example, suffer recognized psychiatric harm from witnessing the event).

### 2. Title for Trespass to Land

This is the most technical and crucial area. The tort of trespass to land does **not** protect ownership; it protects **possession**.

- **Who can sue?** The claimant must prove they were in **exclusive possession** of the land at the time the trespass occurred.
    

**Possession vs. Ownership** This is the key distinction. The person with the legal right to control the land and exclude others from it is the one who can sue.

- **Tenant vs. Landlord**: This is the classic example. A **tenant** leasing a property has exclusive possession. If anyone‚Äîincluding the landlord‚Äîenters the property without permission, it is the **tenant** who has the right to sue in trespass. The landlord, being an owner out of possession, cannot sue for trespass. (Note: If the trespass causes permanent damage to the property, the landlord may have a different legal action for "waste" or "damage to the reversionary interest," but not for trespass).
    
- **Licensees**: A person with a mere license to be on land (like a hotel guest in their room or a dinner guest in a house) does **not** have exclusive possession and therefore cannot sue in trespass. The person in possession (the hotel owner or homeowner) is the proper claimant.

### 3. Title for Trespass to Goods (Chattels)

Similar to trespass to land, the tort of trespass to goods protects possession rather than absolute ownership.

- **Who can sue?** The claimant must be in **possession** of the goods at the time of the direct interference.
    

"Possession" can include:

- **Actual Possession**: The claimant has physical control of the goods.
    
- **Constructive Possession**: The claimant does not have physical control but has the legal right to control the goods (e.g., goods held by their agent).
    

Therefore, a person who has borrowed goods and has them in their possession can sue a third party for trespass to those goods.

These common law rules, particularly the critical distinction between possession and ownership, are the legal standards applied in **Bangladesh** to determine who has the right to bring a claim for trespass.
