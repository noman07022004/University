## 📑 **4.3 Title of Claimant**

---

### 📌 **Introduction**

In a claim for trespass — **especially trespass to land or goods** — the **claimant must prove they have a legal right or interest** in the property interfered with.

This legal right is called the **“title to sue.”**

### 📌 **Who Can Sue for Trespass?**

✅ **Trespass to Person:**

- **Anyone whose body or freedom was interfered with** has title to sue — no one else needs to prove ownership (you always own your own body!).
    

✅ **Trespass to Land:**

- The claimant must have **exclusive possession** — not necessarily ownership.
    
    - Example: A tenant can sue for trespass even if they do not own the property but have a lease.
        
    - Licensees **generally cannot sue** for trespass unless they have exclusive possession.
        

✅ **Trespass to Goods:**

- The claimant must have **possession** or an immediate right to possession of the goods.
    
    - Example: A bailee (someone who holds goods for another, like a dry cleaner) can sue a third party for trespass to the goods.

### 📌 **Key Points**

✔️ **Possession is enough** — Ownership is not always required, especially for land and goods.  
✔️ If multiple people have rights, the one with the **better right to possess** can sue.  
✔️ Mere custodians without right to possess (like an employee) generally can’t sue.

### 📌 **Relevant Cases**

- **Entick v Carrington (1765):** Entick had possession of his house — this gave him standing to sue the King’s messengers for trespass.
    
- **Armory v Delamirie (1722):** A chimney sweep boy found a jewel — his **possession** was enough to sue the goldsmith who took it.

### 📌 **Tip**

✔ For land — focus on **exclusive possession**.  
✔ For goods — focus on **possession or right to immediate possession**.  
✔ For person — the person interfered with always has standing.

---

### ✏️ **Key Takeaway**

✔ You can’t sue for trespass if you have no legal interest or possession.  
✔ Actual possession is usually enough — **ownership is not essential**.  
✔ Right to possession can be temporary (like tenants, bailees).
