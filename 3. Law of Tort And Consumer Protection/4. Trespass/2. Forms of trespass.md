## 📑 **4.2 Forms of Trespass**

---

### 📌 **Introduction**

Trespass is not just one tort — it’s a family of torts grouped under **trespass to person**, **trespass to land**, and **trespass to goods**.  
Each form protects a specific interest: **personal security, property boundaries, and possession of goods**.

---

### 📌 **1️⃣ Trespass to Person**

**Definition:** Direct, intentional, or negligent interference with someone’s body or liberty.

**Forms include:**

✅ **Assault:** An act causing another person to **reasonably apprehend** immediate unlawful force.  
**Example:** Raising a fist to hit someone.

✅ **Battery:** Actual application of unlawful physical force.  
**Example:** Punching or pushing someone.

✅ **False Imprisonment:** Unlawful restraint on a person’s freedom of movement.  
**Example:** Locking someone in a room without consent or authority.

### 📌 **2️⃣ Trespass to Land**

**Definition:** Unlawful, direct physical interference with land in possession of another.

**Examples:**  
✔ Entering someone’s land without permission.  
✔ Throwing things onto someone’s land (like rubbish).  
✔ Staying on land after permission is withdrawn (like overstaying a welcome).

---

### 📌 **3️⃣ Trespass to Goods**

**Definition:** Wrongful physical interference with goods possessed by another.

**Examples:**  
✔ Taking or destroying someone’s movable property.  
✔ Moving someone’s car without permission.  
✔ Damaging goods intentionally or negligently.

In some legal systems, this overlaps with **conversion** and **detinue**, which are specific torts for wrongful possession or refusal to return goods.

### 📌 **Key Features Across Forms**

✔ All forms require direct interference.  
✔ All are **actionable per se** — no need to prove damage.  
✔ Usually intentional but can be negligent.  
✔ Lawful defences exist (e.g., consent, necessity, statutory authority).

### 📌 **Examples of Cases**

- **Assault & Battery:** _Collins v Wilcock_ (1984) — a police officer grabbed a woman’s arm without arresting her, held to be battery.
    
- **Trespass to Land:** _Entick v Carrington_ (1765) — government officers entered Entick’s home unlawfully; held liable for trespass.
    
- **Trespass to Goods:** _Kirk v Gregory_ (1876) — moving jewelry from one room to another without authority = trespass to goods.

### 📌 **Tip**

When writing about forms of trespass:  
✔ Always break it down — person, land, goods.  
✔ Give an example for each.  
✔ Add a short, relevant case name.  
✔ Emphasize **directness** and **actionable per se**.

---

### ✏️ **Key Takeaway**

✔ Trespass covers direct, unlawful interference with **body, land, or goods**.  
✔ Each form is a separate cause of action.  
✔ Defences may justify what would otherwise be trespass.
