## 📑 **4.1 Definition of Trespass**

---

### 📌 **Introduction**

**Trespass** is a civil wrong involving **direct, intentional, or negligent interference** with a person’s body, land, or goods — done **without lawful justification**.

It is one of the oldest common law torts and forms the basis for protecting **personal security**, **property rights**, and **freedom from interference**.

### 📌 **Definition**

> **General Definition:**  
> _Trespass is the unlawful interference with one’s person, property, or goods, done directly and intentionally or negligently._

There are three main types:  
1️⃣ **Trespass to Person** — assault, battery, false imprisonment  
2️⃣ **Trespass to Land** — unlawful entry onto someone’s property  
3️⃣ **Trespass to Goods** — wrongful physical interference with goods (also called conversion or detinue in some contexts)

### 📌 **Key Features**

✔ **Direct Interference:** The wrongful act must be direct (e.g., walking onto land, hitting someone).  
✔ **Actionable Per Se:** Damage or loss does **not** have to be proved. The act itself is enough.  
✔ **Intentional or Negligent:** Usually intentional, but negligent trespass is possible (e.g., careless driving onto someone’s land).  
✔ **Protects Fundamental Rights:** Bodily integrity, property security, freedom from unlawful detention.

### 📌 **Example**

- If A punches B — that’s **battery**, a trespass to person.
    
- If C climbs over D’s boundary wall — that’s **trespass to land**.
    
- If E takes F’s bike without permission — that’s **trespass to goods**.

### 📌 **Relevant Principle**

- **Actionable per se:** Unlike negligence, there’s no need to show harm. The violation of the right itself is the tort.

### 📌 **Tip**

When writing about trespass, always:  
✔ Clearly state it is a direct, unlawful interference.  
✔ Distinguish from negligence (which needs proof of damage).  
✔ Mention it can be to person, land, or goods.  
✔ Use clear examples.  
✔ If possible, add a landmark case (like _Entick v Carrington_ for trespass to land).

---

### ✏️ **Key Takeaway**

✔ Trespass = direct, unlawful interference with protected interests (person, land, goods).  
✔ It is actionable without proof of actual damage.  
✔ It safeguards basic civil rights.
