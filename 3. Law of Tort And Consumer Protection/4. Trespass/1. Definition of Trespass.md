Of course. Let's focus specifically on the definition of trespass.

### 4.1 Definition of Trespass ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: This is the foundational definition that establishes the unique character of trespass. Understanding the core elements of directness, intent, and that it is actionable _per se_ is the essential first step to analyzing any form of trespass and distinguishing it from other torts like negligence. 📜

The tort of trespass is one of the oldest actions in common law. It is defined as a **wrongful, intentional, and direct interference** with a person's body, land, or goods. This definition is built upon three essential elements that collectively distinguish trespass from other torts, particularly negligence.

### Element 1: The Interference Must Be **Direct**

A key feature of trespass is that the interference with the claimant's rights must be **direct and immediate**, not indirect or consequential. The injury or interference must follow so closely from the defendant's act that it can be considered part of the act itself.

The classic illustration is the "log analogy" from _Reynolds v Clarke (1725)_:

- **Direct Interference (Trespass)**: If a person throws a log onto a road and the log, in the act of falling, hits someone, the interference is direct. The action is in trespass.
    
- **Indirect Interference (Negligence)**: If a person throws a log onto a road and, sometime later, another person trips over it and is injured, the interference is indirect or consequential. The action would be in negligence, not trespass.

### Element 2: The Act Must Be **Intentional**

The defendant's act of interference must be intentional and voluntary. However, it is crucial to understand what "intent" means in this context.

The claimant does **not** have to prove that the defendant intended to cause harm or even that they intended to commit a trespass. The claimant only needs to prove that the defendant **intended the physical act that constituted the trespass**. The defendant's motive is irrelevant.

- **Example (Trespass to Land)**: If a person deliberately walks onto a piece of land, they have committed the intentional act of walking onto it. This is sufficient for trespass, even if they honestly and reasonably believed they were walking on their own property.
    
- **Example (Battery)**: If a doctor performs a medical procedure that the patient has not consented to, the doctor has committed the intentional act of touching the patient. This is a battery, even if the doctor's motive was to help the patient.
    

This was clarified in **_Letang v Cooper (1965)_**, where the court established that if an injury is caused **unintentionally**, the proper cause of action is negligence. If it is caused **intentionally**, the action is trespass.

### Element 3: It is **Actionable _Per Se_**

This is a defining characteristic of trespass. It means the tort is actionable **without any proof of actual damage or loss**.

- **Legal Maxim**: This principle reflects the maxim **_injuria sine damno_** (a legal wrong without actual damage).
    
- **Rationale**: The purpose of trespass is to vindicate fundamental rights—the right to bodily integrity and the right to exclusive possession of property. The law considers the violation of the right itself to be the damage.
    
- **Example**: If someone walks across another person's lawn without permission, they have committed a trespass to land. The landowner is entitled to a remedy (at least nominal damages) even if not a single blade of grass was harmed. This contrasts sharply with negligence, where the claimant **must** prove they have suffered legally recognized damage for a claim to succeed.
    

|Feature|**Trespass**|**Negligence**|
|---|---|---|
|**Interference**|**Direct** and immediate|Can be **indirect** or consequential|
|**Mental Element**|**Intentional** act|**Carelessness** / Breach of duty|
|**Proof of Damage**|**Not required** (Actionable _per se_)|**Required** (Damage is the gist of the action)|

This common law definition, with its three core elements, is the exact definition of trespass that is applied by the courts in **Bangladesh**.
