## 📑 **3.10 Defence to Negligence**

---

### **📌 Introduction**

Even if negligence is proved (duty, breach, causation), the defendant can **avoid or reduce liability** by raising **legal defences**.

👉 The main defences in negligence are:  
1️⃣ **Contributory Negligence**  
2️⃣ **Volenti Non Fit Injuria** (Consent)  
3️⃣ **Exclusion of Liability**  
4️⃣ **Statutory Defences**

---

### ✅ **1️⃣ Contributory Negligence**

If the claimant is **partly responsible** for their own harm, damages may be **reduced** proportionately.

✔ Example: Not wearing a seatbelt during an accident.  
✔ **Key Case:** _Froom v Butcher (1976)_ — Damages reduced because claimant didn’t wear a seatbelt.

---

**Effect:**  
✔ Not a complete defence — it reduces the compensation.  
✔ Courts decide what % of fault lies with claimant vs defendant.

---

### ✅ **2️⃣ Volenti Non Fit Injuria (Consent)**

Latin for **“to one who consents, no harm is done.”**

✔ If the claimant **freely and knowingly accepted the risk**, they cannot claim damages.

**Key points:**

- Consent must be **voluntary**.
    
- Claimant must have **full knowledge** of the risk.
    

---

**Examples:**

- A spectator hit by a ball at a cricket match.
    
- A passenger who knowingly accepts a drunk driver’s lift (but courts apply this cautiously).
    

**Key Case:** _Morris v Murray (1991)_ — Passenger willingly flew with drunk pilot — defence succeeded.

---

### ✅ **3️⃣ Exclusion of Liability**

Sometimes a defendant can limit or exclude liability by contract or notice.

✔ Example: A sign saying “Park at your own risk.”  
✔ But under laws like the **Unfair Contract Terms Act**, certain exclusions are void or must be reasonable.

---

### ✅ **4️⃣ Statutory Defences**

Some statutes provide defences or immunity for certain activities.

✔ Example: Emergency services acting in good faith.  
✔ Some acts limit claims against the state or government officers.

---

### ✅ **Illegality**

If the claimant was engaged in an illegal act at the time, they may be barred from recovering damages.

**Key Case:** _Ashton v Turner (1981)_ — Injured while escaping after burglary — no claim allowed.

### 📝 **Exam Tip**

✔ Always explain **contributory negligence** and **volenti** with clear examples.  
✔ Name at least **one case** (e.g., _Froom v Butcher_, _Morris v Murray_).  
✔ Mention the **effect** — reduction vs complete bar to claim.
