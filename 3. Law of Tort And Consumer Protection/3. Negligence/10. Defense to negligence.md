Of course. Let's cover the final subtopic on the defenses to negligence.

### 3.10 Defense to Negligence ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: This is the final and crucial stage of analyzing a negligence claim. After the claimant has established all four elements of the tort, the defendant's only hope is to raise a valid defense. A successful defense can either completely eliminate or significantly reduce liability, making this a highly important and examinable topic. üõ°Ô∏è

Even if a claimant successfully proves duty, breach, causation, and damage, the defendant can still avoid or reduce liability by establishing one of the following three major defenses.

---

### 1. Contributory Negligence

This is the most common defense raised in negligence claims. It is a **partial defense**.

- **Definition**: Contributory negligence occurs when the claimant's own failure to take reasonable care for their own safety contributes to the harm they suffer.
    
- **Effect**: It does not defeat the claim entirely. Instead, the court will **apportion** the fault between the claimant and the defendant and **reduce the claimant's damages** by a percentage that reflects their share of the responsibility for the harm.
    
- **The Test**: The defendant must prove that:
    
    1. The claimant was at fault (i.e., failed to take reasonable care for their own safety).
        
    2. This fault was a contributing cause of the injury.
        
- **Examples**:
    
    - A driver is injured in a collision caused by a negligent defendant, but the claimant's injuries were made worse because they were not wearing a seatbelt (_Froom v Butcher_). The damages would be reduced (typically by 15-25%).
        
    - A pedestrian is hit by a speeding car, but they crossed the road without looking.
        
    - An employee is injured by faulty machinery but had failed to use the safety guard provided by the employer.

### 2. _Volenti Non Fit Injuria_ (Consent)

This is a **complete defense**. If it succeeds, the claimant receives no damages.

- **Meaning**: The Latin maxim translates to **"to a willing person, no injury is done."** It is also known as the voluntary assumption of risk.
    
- **The Test**: The defendant must prove that the claimant had:
    
    1. **Full knowledge** of the nature and extent of the risk.
        
    2. **Voluntarily agreed** to accept that specific risk of harm.
        
- **High Threshold**: This defense is very difficult to establish because the consent must be truly free and voluntary. Courts are particularly reluctant to apply it in certain situations:
    
    - **Employees**: An employee who is aware of a risk at work is generally not considered to be acting voluntarily; they are acting under the compulsion of their employment contract (_Smith v Charles Baker & Sons_).
        
    - **Rescuers**: The defense does not apply to a rescuer who is injured while attempting to save someone from a danger created by the defendant's negligence (_Haynes v Harwood_).

### 3. _Ex Turpi Causa Non Oritur Actio_ (Illegality)

This is also a **complete defense**.

- **Meaning**: The Latin translates to **"from a dishonorable cause, no action arises."**
    
- **The Principle**: The law will not assist a claimant who suffered their injury while engaged in a significant illegal or immoral act. It is a matter of public policy that a person should not be able to recover compensation for the consequences of their own criminal conduct.
    
- **Application**: The defense applies where the claimant's claim is inextricably linked to their illegal act. The court will not allow a claim which would be an affront to the public conscience.
    
- **Example**: If two people are engaged in a joint criminal enterprise, such as robbing a bank, and one is injured by the other's negligent driving of the getaway car, the court will likely refuse the claim based on the illegality defense.
    

In **Bangladesh**, these three common law defenses are fully recognized. For **contributory negligence**, the courts apply the modern principle of apportionment (reducing damages) based on fairness and equity, rather than the old common law rule which treated it as a complete bar to a claim.
