Of course. Let us proceed to the next subtopic, the breach of duty.

### 3.6 Breach of Duty ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: This is the 'fault' element of negligence. Establishing a duty is not enough; the claimant must prove the defendant's conduct fell below the required legal standard. Analyzing the standard of care and the factors determining breach is a critical skill for every negligence problem. 🔬

Once a duty of care is established, the claimant must prove that the defendant **breached** that duty. A breach occurs when the defendant's conduct falls below the standard of care required by law. This involves a two-part inquiry: first, what was the required standard of care (a question of law), and second, did the defendant's actions fail to meet that standard (a question of fact).

### The Standard of Care: The "Reasonable Person"

The fundamental standard of care in negligence is **objective**. It is the standard of the **"reasonable person."** The classic formulation comes from Baron Alderson in **_Blyth v Birmingham Waterworks Co. (1856)_**:

> The defendant must do something "which a prudent and reasonable man would not do" or omit to do something "which a reasonable man... would do."

This "reasonable person" is a hypothetical, objective benchmark. The court does not ask whether the defendant did their personal best. Instead, it asks whether the defendant's conduct met the standard of a reasonably competent person in the circumstances. This means that a defendant's personal characteristics, such as being a learner or inexperienced, are generally irrelevant. In **_Nettleship v Weston (1971)_**, a learner driver was held to the same standard as a reasonably competent and experienced driver.

#### Special Standards of Care

While the "reasonable person" is the general standard, it is adapted for certain defendants:

- **Professionals**: A person professing a special skill or profession (e.g., a doctor, lawyer, or engineer) is judged by the standard of the reasonably competent professional in that field. This is known as the **Bolam Test**, from **_Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee (1957)_**. A professional is not in breach if they act in accordance with a practice accepted as proper by a responsible body of professional opinion, even if other professionals disagree. However, the courts have added that this professional practice must be capable of withstanding logical analysis (the **_Bolitho_** **test**).
    
- **Children**: A child defendant is not judged by the standard of a reasonable adult. Instead, they are judged by the standard of a **reasonable child of the same age**.

### Factors in Determining a Breach: The Calculus of Risk

To decide whether the defendant's conduct was unreasonable, the court performs a balancing act, weighing several factors. This is often called the "calculus of risk."

**1. The Probability of Harm** The greater the likelihood that the defendant's conduct will cause harm, the more care is expected.

- In **_Bolton v Stone (1951)_**, a cricket ball was hit out of a ground, injuring the claimant. As this had happened only a handful of times in decades, the risk was held to be so small that the club was not negligent for failing to take further precautions.
    

**2. The Severity of Potential Harm** The more serious the potential injury, the greater the precautions that are required.

- In **_Paris v Stepney Borough Council (1951)_**, an employer failed to provide safety goggles to a mechanic who had only one good eye. A metal chip blinded his good eye. The employer was held liable because although the risk of injury was small, the potential severity of the harm to a one-eyed man was catastrophic, demanding greater precautions.
    

**3. The Cost of Precautions** The court balances the risk against the cost and practicality of the measures needed to eliminate it. The law does not expect a defendant to go to extraordinary expense to eliminate a small risk.

- In **_Latimer v AEC Ltd (1953)_**, a factory floor became slippery after a flood. The owners put down sawdust but did not have enough to cover the whole area. The only way to eliminate the risk completely would have been to close the factory. The court held the defendant was not in breach, as the cost of this precaution was disproportionate to the risk.
    

**4. The Social Utility of the Activity** If the defendant's activity provides a significant benefit to society, the court may be more lenient in finding a breach.

- In **_Watt v Hertfordshire County Council (1954)_**, a firefighter was injured by unsecured equipment while rushing to an emergency to save a life. The court held that the urgency and social importance of saving a life outweighed the need to take normal safety precautions.
    

The courts in **Bangladesh** apply this same objective "reasonable person" standard and weigh these same factors to determine if a defendant has been negligent.
