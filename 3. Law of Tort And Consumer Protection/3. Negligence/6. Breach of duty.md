## 📑 **3.6 Breach of Duty**

---

### **📌 Introduction**

Once you establish that a **duty of care** exists, the next question is:  
👉 **Did the defendant breach that duty?**

A **breach** means the defendant **failed to meet the standard of care** that the law expects in the circumstances.

---

### **📌 What is Breach of Duty?**

✔ A person breaches their duty if they do **not act as a reasonable person** would in the same situation.  
✔ The test is **objective** — what would a **reasonable, prudent person** do?

---

### ✅ **Key Case: Blyth v Birmingham Waterworks Co. (1856)**

**Definition:**

> _“Negligence is the omission to do something which a reasonable man would do, or doing something which a reasonable man would not do.”_

---

### **📌 Standard of Care**

The court compares the defendant’s actions to a **standard**:

- Not perfect behaviour — just **reasonable**.
    
- Standard may vary depending on context.
    

---

### ✅ **Factors Affecting Standard of Care**

---

### **1️⃣ Probability of Harm**

- The greater the risk, the greater the care required.
    
- _Case:_ **Bolton v Stone (1951)** — A cricket club was not negligent when a ball hit a passerby; the risk was extremely low.
    

---

### **2️⃣ Seriousness of Harm**

- Greater care is required if the possible harm could be very serious.
    
- _Case:_ **Paris v Stepney Borough Council (1951)** — Worker had only one good eye; employer should have taken extra care to provide goggles.
    

---

### **3️⃣ Cost and Practicality of Precautions**

- Courts balance the risk against the cost of avoiding it.
    
- _Case:_ **Latimer v AEC Ltd (1953)** — Factory flooded; company spread sawdust to prevent slips. Court held it was reasonable — no need to close the whole factory.
    

---

### **4️⃣ Utility of Defendant’s Conduct**

- If the act has social utility, more risk may be acceptable.
    
- _Example:_ Firefighter driving fast to save lives.
    

---

### ✅ **Special Standards**

- **Professionals:** Held to the standard of an ordinary skilled professional in their field.
    
    - _Key Case:_ **Bolam v Friern Hospital (1957)** — If a doctor acts according to a practice accepted by a responsible body of medical opinion, there’s no breach.
        
- **Learners:** Same standard as a reasonably competent person.
    
    - _Case:_ **Nettleship v Weston (1971)** — Learner driver owes same duty as an experienced driver.
        

---

### ✅ **Res Ipsa Loquitur**

Sometimes the facts **speak for themselves** — so the burden shifts to the defendant to prove they were **not negligent**.

- _Example:_ Surgical instrument left inside a patient.
    
- _Key Case:_ **Scott v London & St Katherine Docks Co. (1865)**.

✔ Courts balance **risk**, **seriousness**, **cost**, and **utility**.  
✔ Professionals judged by their peers (_Bolam_).  
✔ _Res ipsa loquitur_ helps claimants prove breach.
