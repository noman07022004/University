Of course. Here is a detailed examination of the duty of care.

### 3.2 Duty of Care ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: The duty of care is the first and most fundamental element of a negligence claim. It acts as the legal control mechanism that determines whether a relationship is one where the law will impose an obligation of care. Without establishing a duty, no action for negligence can succeed. 🛑

A duty of care is the legal obligation to take reasonable care to avoid causing foreseeable harm to another. It is the essential starting point for any claim in negligence. If no duty of care is owed by the defendant to the claimant, the claim will fail at the very first hurdle, regardless of how careless the defendant was or how much damage was caused.

#### The Historical Development: From Categories to a General Principle

Before 1932, the law did not recognize a general duty of care. Instead, duties were only found to exist in specific, pre-defined categories or "pockets" of liability, such as doctor-patient, innkeeper-guest, or carrier-passenger. If a situation did not fit into one of these existing categories, no duty was owed.

This rigid approach was revolutionized by the House of Lords in the seminal case of **_Donoghue v Stevenson (1932)_**.

- **Facts**: Mrs. Donoghue became ill after drinking a bottle of ginger beer that was later found to contain the decomposed remains of a snail. The bottle was opaque, so the snail could not be seen until most of the drink was consumed. As her friend had purchased the drink, Mrs. Donoghue had no contractual relationship with the manufacturer.
    
- **The Ruling**: In a landmark decision, the court held that the manufacturer owed a duty of care to the ultimate consumer, Mrs. Donoghue.
    

In his judgment, **Lord Atkin** formulated the **"neighbour principle,"** which established a general test for the existence of a duty of care:

> "You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour. Who, then, in law, is my neighbour? The answer seems to be – **persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation** as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question."

The neighbour principle established that the existence of a duty was no longer dependent on established categories but on the twin principles of **reasonable foreseeability** and **proximity**.

### The Modern Test: The _Caparo_ Three-Stage Test

The neighbour principle, while groundbreaking, was later seen as potentially too expansive. The modern law has adopted a more cautious, incremental approach as established in **_Caparo Industries plc v Dickman (1990)_**.

Today, in novel or difficult cases where a duty of care is not already established by precedent, the court will apply a **three-stage test**:

#### 1. Reasonable Foreseeability of Harm

Was it reasonably foreseeable that the defendant's actions or omissions could cause the _kind_ of harm suffered by the claimant? This is an objective test. For example, it is reasonably foreseeable that careless driving could cause physical injury to a pedestrian.

#### 2. Proximity

Was there a sufficiently "proximate" relationship between the claimant and the defendant? Proximity does not simply mean physical closeness; it refers to a legal closeness or a directness in the relationship. This could include a pre-existing legal relationship or the direct impact of the defendant's actions on the claimant.

#### 3. Fair, Just, and Reasonable

Is it fair, just, and reasonable for the law to impose a duty of care on the defendant in this situation? This is a crucial **policy consideration**. The court weighs the potential impact of its decision on society as a whole. It might decide not to impose a duty if doing so would:

- Open the "floodgates" to a vast number of similar claims.
    
- Lead to defensive practices (e.g., police being too cautious in their investigations).
    
- Be an inefficient way of allocating resources.
    

It is important to note that in straightforward, everyday situations like road traffic accidents or doctor-patient relationships, the existence of a duty of care is so well-established by precedent that the court does not need to apply the _Caparo_ test.

In **Bangladesh**, the courts have fully adopted these common law principles. The "neighbour principle" from _Donoghue v Stevenson_ and the refined three-stage test from _Caparo_ provide the essential framework for determining the existence of a duty of care in all negligence litigation.
