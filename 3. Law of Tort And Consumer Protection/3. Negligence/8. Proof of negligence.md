Of course. Let's discuss the principles related to the proof of negligence.

### 3.8 Proof of Negligence ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: This subtopic deals with the crucial procedural question of how a claimant satisfies their legal burden. The doctrine of _res ipsa loquitur_ is a particularly important concept that can reverse the burden of proof, making it a powerful tool for claimants and a common subject in examinations. 🧾

### The Burden of Proof

In any negligence claim, the fundamental rule is that the **burden of proof rests on the claimant**. This means the claimant has the legal duty to produce evidence and persuade the court, on the **balance of probabilities** (i.e., that it is more likely than not), that each element of the tort has been satisfied:

1. The defendant owed the claimant a duty of care.
    
2. The defendant breached that duty.
    
3. The breach caused the claimant's damage.
    

If the claimant fails to provide sufficient evidence to prove any one of these elements, their claim will fail. However, the law recognizes that in some situations, a claimant may be unable to know or prove the precise negligent act that caused their injury. In these specific circumstances, the claimant may be assisted by the doctrine of _res ipsa loquitur_.

### _Res Ipsa Loquitur_ ("The Thing Speaks for Itself")

_Res ipsa loquitur_ is a rule of evidence that allows a court to **infer negligence** on the part of the defendant from the very nature of the accident, even without direct evidence of the defendant's failure. It is not a separate legal principle but a rule of evidence that affects the burden of proof.

**Effect of the Doctrine**: When _res ipsa loquitur_ applies, it raises a _prima facie_ presumption of negligence. The burden of proof then **shifts** to the defendant, who must provide a plausible explanation of how the accident could have occurred without their negligence. If the defendant cannot do so, the court is entitled to find them liable.

#### The Three Conditions for Application

For the doctrine of _res ipsa loquitur_ to apply, the claimant must establish three conditions:

**1. The Thing Causing the Harm was under the Defendant's Exclusive Control** The object, instrumentality, or situation that caused the injury must have been under the management and control of the defendant or their employees. This requirement links the circumstantial evidence of negligence directly to the defendant.

**2. The Accident Would Not Ordinarily Happen Without Negligence** The event must be of a type that does not normally occur if proper care is taken. It must "scream negligence." Common experience suggests that carelessness must be the most likely explanation.

- **Examples**: A crane collapsing on a construction site, a surgical instrument being left inside a patient, or two trains colliding on the same track.
    

**3. There is No Other Plausible Explanation** The cause of the accident must be unknown to the claimant, and there should be no evidence of any other plausible cause (such as an act of God or the claimant's own actions). If the facts are known, then the claimant must prove negligence in the normal way; the doctrine is a tool for when direct evidence is unavailable.

**The Landmark Case: _Scott v London and St Katherine Docks Co (1865)_**

- **Facts**: The claimant was standing near the doorway of the defendant's warehouse when several heavy bags of sugar fell from a crane and injured him. He could not prove how or why they fell.
    
- **Ruling**: The court held that the doctrine applied. The warehouse and crane were under the defendant's control, bags of sugar do not normally fall from a crane without some negligence, and there was no other explanation. The facts spoke for themselves, and it was up to the defendant to prove they were not negligent.
    

In **Bangladesh**, the doctrine of _res ipsa loquitur_ is a recognized and applied principle of evidence law, used by the courts in the same way as other common law jurisdictions, particularly in cases of medical negligence and industrial accidents where the claimant is at an informational disadvantage.
