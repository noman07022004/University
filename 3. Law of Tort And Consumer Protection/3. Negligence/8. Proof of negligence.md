## 📑 **3.8 Proof of Negligence**

---

### **📌 Introduction**

In negligence claims, the **burden of proof** is on the **claimant** (injured party).  
👉 The claimant must prove **on the balance of probabilities** that:  
1️⃣ The defendant owed a duty of care.  
2️⃣ The duty was breached.  
3️⃣ The breach caused damage that is not too remote.

---

### **📌 Who Must Prove?**

✔ The general rule:  
**He who alleges must prove.**  
So, the **claimant** must provide evidence of:

- Duty
    
- Breach
    
- Causation
    

---

### ✅ **Standard of Proof**

✔ In civil cases like torts, the standard is **balance of probabilities** —  
👉 Is it **more likely than not** that negligence happened?

This is different from criminal law (**beyond reasonable doubt**).

---

### ✅ **Ways to Prove Negligence**

---

### **1️⃣ Direct Evidence**

- Witnesses, documents, expert reports.
    
- Example: CCTV, medical reports, expert testimony.
    

---

### **2️⃣ Circumstantial Evidence**

- Sometimes direct evidence is not possible.
    
- Courts can draw **reasonable inferences** from the facts.
    

---

### **3️⃣ Res Ipsa Loquitur**

✔ Means **“the thing speaks for itself.”**  
✔ If the accident is of a type that **would not happen without negligence**, the burden shifts to the defendant to prove they were **not negligent**.

**Key Case: Scott v London & St Katherine Docks Co. (1865)**  
— Plaintiff hit by bags of sugar falling from warehouse — such accidents don’t happen without negligence.

---

**Conditions for Res Ipsa Loquitur:**  
✅ Thing causing harm was under defendant’s control.  
✅ Accident normally does not happen without negligence.  
✅ Claimant did not contribute.

---

**Examples:**

- Surgical instrument left inside patient.
    
- Car swerving onto the footpath.
    

---

### ✅ **Expert Evidence**

- Often used in **medical negligence** or technical cases.
    
- Experts explain the standard of care and whether it was breached.
    

---

### ✅ **Burden of Proof May Shift**

✔ In rare cases, if the defendant has special knowledge, the burden shifts.  
✔ Example: In **medical negligence**, hospital records are in the hospital’s control.
