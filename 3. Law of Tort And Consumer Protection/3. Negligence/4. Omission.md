## 📑 **3.4 Omission**

---

### **📌 Introduction**

In negligence, there’s a **general rule** that a person is **not liable for pure omissions** — that means **failing to act**, rather than doing something carelessly.

👉 **Key idea:** The law usually imposes liability for **acts**, not for failing to prevent harm.

---

### **📜 What is an Omission?**

✔ An **omission** is when someone **does nothing** where they could have acted to prevent harm.

Example:

- You see a child drowning but do not help — generally, you’re **not liable**, unless there’s a special duty.
    

---

### **📌 General Rule: No Duty to Act**

Courts usually say:

> _“A person has no duty to rescue or protect another from harm caused by a third party or natural causes.”_

---

### ✅ **Exceptions — When a Duty to Act Exists**

In certain situations, the law **does impose a duty** to act:

---

### **1️⃣ Special Relationship**

- Parent–child, teacher–student, employer–employee.
    
- Example: A lifeguard has a duty to save swimmers.
    

---

### **2️⃣ Assumption of Responsibility**

- If you **voluntarily take charge**, you must act with reasonable care.
    
- Example: You start helping a drowning person, then leave them — you may be liable.
    

---

### **3️⃣ Creating a Dangerous Situation**

- If your **prior conduct** creates a risk, you have a duty to prevent harm.
    
- Example: You drop oil on the road — you must warn others or clean it.
    

---

### **4️⃣ Control Over Third Parties**

- Sometimes, you may have a duty to control others.
    
- Example: A prison has a duty to control dangerous prisoners.
    

---

### ✅ **Key Case**

**Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co (1970)**

- Borstal officers failed to stop boys escaping; the boys damaged yachts.
    
- Held: Officers had **control**, so they owed a duty to prevent the harm.

### **📌 Omissions vs. Positive Acts**

✔ Positive acts: Law more willing to impose liability.  
✔ Omissions: Law cautious — no general duty to rescue.

### ✅ **Possible Exam Question**

> _“Explain the concept of omissions in negligence and when a duty to act arises.”_

---

### 📌 **Key Takeaways**

✔ **No duty for pure omissions** — general rule.  
✔ Duty may arise if:

- Special relationship
    
- Assumed responsibility
    
- Created a risk
    
- Control over third party  
    ✔ Leading case: _Dorset Yacht Case_.
