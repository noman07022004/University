Of course, here is the next subtopic on omissions.

### 3.4 Omission ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: This subtopic is crucial for understanding the limits of the duty of care. The general rule that you are not liable for failing to act is a fundamental aspect of negligence, and knowing the specific exceptions to this rule is key to analyzing more complex duty of care scenarios. üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### The General Rule: No Liability for Omissions

The starting principle in the law of negligence is that there is **no general duty to act**. A person is not liable for a mere **omission**‚Äîa failure to do something‚Äîeven if that failure results in harm to another.

The law distinguishes between:

- **Misfeasance (a wrongful act)**: The law readily imposes liability for causing harm through a positive, wrongful act (e.g., carelessly driving a car).
    
- **Nonfeasance (a wrongful failure to act)**: The law is extremely reluctant to impose liability for failing to confer a benefit on someone, such as preventing harm from another source.
    

This means that if you see a stranger drowning, you have no legal duty to attempt a rescue. The law does not compel a person to be a "Good Samaritan."

**Rationale for the Rule:** This principle is based on a core philosophy of **individual liberty**. The law prizes personal autonomy and is reluctant to impose obligations that would require individuals to act in a certain way, as it would be an infringement on their freedom. Furthermore, imposing a general duty to act would create immense practical difficulties in defining the scope of such a duty.

### The Exceptions: When a Duty to Act _is_ Imposed

While the general rule is strong, the law recognizes several exceptional situations where a defendant **does** have a positive duty to take action to prevent harm to the claimant.

**1. A Special Relationship between the Parties** A pre-existing relationship can create a positive duty to act. Such relationships are often based on a high degree of dependence or a responsibility to protect.

- **Examples**:
    
    - Parent and child.
        
    - Employer and employee (an employer has a duty to provide a safe system of work).
        
    - School and pupil.
        
    - Doctor and patient.
        

**2. Assumption of Responsibility** A duty to act arises when a person voluntarily **assumes responsibility** for the claimant's safety.

- **Example**: In **_Barrett v Ministry of Defence (1995)_**, a naval airman became extremely drunk. A senior officer ordered him to be taken to his bunk. No one checked on him, and he later died from choking on his own vomit. The court held that while the MOD was not responsible for stopping him from getting drunk, once the officer **assumed responsibility** for his care, a duty arose to carry out that care properly.
    

**3. Control over a Third Party Who Causes the Harm** A duty to act may be imposed on a defendant who has a special relationship of **control** over a third party.

- **Example**: The leading case is **_Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co Ltd (1970)_**. Borstal (youth detention) officers were supervising young offenders on an island. The officers negligently fell asleep, allowing the offenders to escape and damage the claimants' yachts. The Home Office was held liable because the officers had a duty to control the offenders, which arose from their specific position of authority.
    

**4. Creation or Adoption of a Risk** If a defendant creates a dangerous situation, even innocently, they come under a duty to take reasonable steps to prevent that danger from causing harm.

- **Example**: In **_Capital & Counties plc v Hampshire County Council (1997)_**, the court affirmed that a fire brigade has no general duty to attend a fire. However, in one of the cases considered, a fire officer negligently ordered the sprinkler system in a burning building to be turned off. This positive act made the fire worse. The fire brigade was held liable, not for failing to put out the fire (an omission), but for its positive act of turning off the sprinklers which increased the damage.
    

The courts in **Bangladesh** follow these same common law principles to determine whether a duty to act exists in any given negligence claim.
