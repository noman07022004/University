Of course. Let's explore the complex topic of economic loss in negligence.

### 3.3 Economic Loss ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: This is a complex but crucial area that defines the boundaries of negligence liability. Courts are very cautious about awarding damages for pure financial loss, and understanding the rules and the key exception for negligent misstatement is essential for analyzing modern commercial tort claims. 💰

In the law of negligence, "economic loss" refers to financial harm. However, the law does not treat all financial harm equally. It makes a fundamental distinction between two types of economic loss, and this distinction is the key to understanding the entire topic.

### The Crucial Distinction

1. **Consequential Economic Loss**: This is financial loss that is a direct consequence of a physical injury to the claimant or damage to their property. **This type of loss is generally recoverable.**
    
    - **Example**: A negligent driver crashes into and injures a taxi driver. The taxi driver's financial losses—such as the cost of medical treatment, repairs to the taxi, and loss of income while unable to work—are all consequential economic loss. They flow directly from the physical injury and property damage.
        
2. **Pure Economic Loss**: This is financial loss that is _not_ connected to any physical injury to the claimant or damage to their property. It is purely financial. **The general rule is that this type of loss is NOT recoverable.**
    
    - **Example**: A negligent contractor accidentally cuts an electricity cable that supplies power to a whole street. A local bakery, which suffers no physical damage, is forced to close for the day and loses a day's profits. This lost profit is a pure economic loss.

### The General Rule: No Recovery for Pure Economic Loss

The long-standing rule in common law is that there is no duty of care owed in respect of pure economic loss. This is known as the "exclusionary rule."

**Policy Reasons for the Rule:** Courts have adopted this restrictive approach for several important policy reasons:

- **The "Floodgates" Argument**: Allowing claims for pure economic loss could open the floodgates to an overwhelming number of lawsuits. A single negligent act could cause a ripple effect of financial loss to a vast and unpredictable number of people.
    
- **Fear of Indeterminate Liability**: It could expose defendants to liability "in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class" (as famously stated by Cardozo C.J. in the US case _Ultramares Corp v. Touche_).
    
- **Relationship with Contract Law**: Many financial relationships are governed by contracts. Tort law is reluctant to impose duties that might cut across or undermine the contractual allocation of risk that the parties have negotiated for themselves.
    

The leading case illustrating this rule is **_Spartan Steel & Alloys Ltd v Martin & Co (Contractors) Ltd (1973)_**. In this case, the defendants negligently cut a power cable to the plaintiffs' factory. The court held that the plaintiffs could recover damages for the metal that solidified in the furnace (physical damage) and the lost profit on that specific batch of metal (consequential economic loss). However, they could **not** recover the lost profits on other batches they could have made during the power cut, as this was a non-recoverable pure economic loss.

### The Major Exception: Negligent Misstatement

The most significant exception to the exclusionary rule is for pure economic loss caused by a **negligent misstatement** (i.e., careless advice or information).

The law in this area was established by the House of Lords in **_Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd (1964)_**. The court held that a duty of care to avoid causing pure economic loss _can_ arise in cases of negligent misstatement where there is a **"special relationship"** between the parties.

For such a duty to exist, the following conditions must generally be met:

1. There is a **special relationship of trust and confidence** between the person giving and the person receiving the advice. This often, but not always, involves a professional relationship.
    
2. The party giving the advice **assumes responsibility** for its accuracy.
    
3. The other party **reasonably relies** on the advice.
    
4. This reliance causes the financial loss.
    

Therefore, a professional like a banker, accountant, or surveyor can be held liable for the pure economic loss suffered by a client who reasonably relies on their carelessly provided advice.

In **Bangladesh**, this common law distinction between recoverable consequential loss and non-recoverable pure economic loss is followed. The principles from _Hedley Byrne_ concerning negligent misstatement are highly persuasive and form the basis for liability for professional financial advice.
