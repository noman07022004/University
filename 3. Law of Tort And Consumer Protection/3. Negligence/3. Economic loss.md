## 📑 **3.3 Economic Loss**

---

### **📌 Introduction**

In negligence, **not all losses are recoverable**. The law distinguishes between:

- **Physical damage** (to body or property) — _always claimable if negligence is proven_.
    
- **Pure economic loss** — _financial loss not directly connected to any physical damage_ — often **not recoverable** unless special rules apply.

### **📌 What is Economic Loss?**

✔ **Economic Loss:** Financial loss suffered due to someone’s negligent act or omission.  
✔ **Pure Economic Loss:** Loss that is **not** a consequence of physical harm to the claimant or their property.

---

### **📌 Examples**

- If a careless driver crashes into a power line, causing a factory to lose production time = **economic loss linked to physical damage** (may be recoverable).
    
- If an accountant carelessly audits a company, leading to investors losing money = **pure economic loss** (special rules apply).

### **📌 General Rule**

The courts are **reluctant to allow claims** for pure economic loss because:  
✔ It can lead to unlimited claims.  
✔ Difficult to prove direct responsibility.  
✔ Risk of **floodgates** — too many people could claim for the same loss.

### **📌 When is Economic Loss Recoverable?**

✅ **Consequential Economic Loss**

- Financial loss resulting **directly from physical damage** caused by negligence is claimable.
    
    - _Example:_ If A negligently damages B’s car, B can claim repair costs + lost income if the car was used for business.

✅ **Pure Economic Loss — Exceptional Cases**

- Only allowed if there is a **special relationship** giving rise to a duty of care for financial advice or services.
    

**Key Case:** _Hedley Byrne v Heller (1964)_

- Facts: Bank gave negligent financial reference, causing client to lose money.
    
- Held: If a person **voluntarily assumes responsibility** for a statement or advice, and the claimant **reasonably relies** on it, they may be liable for pure economic loss.
