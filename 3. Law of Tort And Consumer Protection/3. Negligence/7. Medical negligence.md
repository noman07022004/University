## 📑 **3.7 Medical Negligence**

---

### **📌 Introduction**

**Medical negligence** is a **special branch of negligence** that deals with the duty doctors and healthcare professionals owe to their patients.

👉 When a doctor fails to exercise **reasonable care, skill, or knowledge**, and this causes harm to a patient, they may be **liable for negligence**.

---

### **📌 Why is it Important?**

✔ Health professionals hold **special trust**.  
✔ Errors can cause serious injury or death.  
✔ The law balances **patient protection** with the need to let doctors make **professional judgments** without fear of constant lawsuits.

---

### ✅ **Elements of Medical Negligence**

A patient must prove:  
1️⃣ **Duty of care** — A doctor–patient relationship exists.  
2️⃣ **Breach of duty** — The doctor did not meet the expected standard.  
3️⃣ **Damage** — The breach caused harm that is not too remote.

### **📜 Standard of Care in Medicine**

Doctors are judged **not by perfection**, but by the standard of a **reasonable, competent doctor** in that particular field.

👉 This means junior doctors are judged by the **standard of a qualified doctor**, not a beginner.

---

### ✅ **Key Case: Bolam v Friern Hospital (1957)**

**Bolam Test:**

> A doctor is **not negligent** if they act according to a practice accepted by a **responsible body of medical opinion**, even if other doctors disagree.

---

### ✅ **Bolitho Modification**

**Bolitho v City and Hackney Health Authority (1997)**  
Courts can reject a medical opinion if it is **not reasonable or logical**. So, **expert evidence must stand up to logic**.

---

### ✅ **Common Examples**

✔ **Surgical errors** — Leaving instruments inside the patient.  
✔ **Wrong diagnosis** — Misreading test results.  
✔ **Lack of consent** — Not telling the patient about risks.  
✔ **Negligent treatment** — Using wrong method or medicine.

### ✅ **Informed Consent**

Modern law says patients must be told about **material risks**.

**Key Case:** _Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board (2015)_  
Doctors must explain risks that a **reasonable patient** would want to know to make an informed choice.
