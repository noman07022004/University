Of course. Let's examine the specific application of negligence principles to the medical profession.

### 3.7 Medical Negligence ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: This is a critical and high-stakes application of negligence principles. Cases of medical malpractice are of huge public interest and involve complex questions of professional standards. It's a major area of tort litigation and an important topic for understanding how the 'reasonable person' test is adapted for highly skilled professionals. 🩺

Medical negligence, also known as clinical negligence, is not a distinct tort in itself. Rather, it is the application of the general principles of negligence to the specific context of healthcare professionals. It occurs when a medical professional, through a negligent act or omission, breaches the duty of care they owe to a patient, resulting in harm.

While all four elements of negligence (duty, breach, causation, damage) must be proven, the central focus of any medical negligence case is the **breach of duty**, specifically, the **standard of care** expected of a medical professional.

### 1. The Standard of Care: The _Bolam_ Test

The standard of care for a professional is not that of the "reasonable person on the street." Instead, it is the standard of a reasonably competent professional in that field. The foundational test for medical professionals was established in **_Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee (1957)_**.

**The _Bolam_ Test**: A medical professional is not in breach of their duty of care if they have acted in accordance with a practice accepted as proper by a **responsible body of medical opinion**.

This means that if a doctor's actions are supported by a group of respected professionals who would have done the same thing, the doctor will not be found negligent—even if another group of experts would have acted differently. The law will not choose between competing professional opinions. This test was seen as providing significant protection to the medical profession.

### 2. The _Bolitho_ Qualification

The _Bolam_ test was later qualified by the House of Lords in **_Bolitho v City and Hackney Health Authority (1998)_**.

**The _Bolitho_ Qualification**: The court must be satisfied that the body of professional opinion relied upon has a **rational and logical basis**. A court can reject a professional opinion if it is not logically defensible. This gives the judge the final say, preventing the medical profession from being the ultimate arbiter of its own standards if a common practice is itself found to be illogical.

### 3. Application to Specific Duties

The professional standard of care applies to all aspects of a patient's treatment, including:

- **Diagnosis**: A misdiagnosis will be considered negligent if no reasonably competent doctor in that specialty would have made the same error based on the available information.
    
- **Treatment**: A doctor can be liable for performing a procedure incompetently or for providing the wrong treatment.
    
- **Duty to Warn of Risks (Informed Consent)**: This is a major area of modern medical negligence law. A doctor has a duty to disclose the **material risks** of a proposed treatment to a patient. The modern UK law, following **_Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board (2015)_**, has shifted the focus from what a reasonable doctor would disclose to what a **reasonable patient** would want to know. A risk is "material" if a reasonable person in the patient's position would be likely to attach significance to it. This is central to the principle of patient autonomy and informed consent.

### Medical Negligence in Bangladesh

The legal framework for medical negligence in Bangladesh is primarily based on the common law principles of tort.

- **Standard of Care**: The principles from the **Bolam Test** are highly persuasive and are generally applied by the courts to determine the standard of care expected from doctors.
    
- **Challenges**: Pursuing a tort claim for medical negligence in Bangladesh faces significant practical challenges, including a reluctance among doctors to testify against their colleagues, a lack of public awareness of legal rights, and the high cost and slow pace of civil litigation.
    
- **Alternative Remedies**: Due to these difficulties, aggrieved parties often resort to filing criminal cases against doctors under **Section 304A of the Penal Code, 1860** (causing death by a rash or negligent act).
    
- **Growing Trend**: Despite the challenges, public awareness is increasing, and the higher courts in Bangladesh are becoming more active in adjudicating medical negligence cases and upholding patients' rights, including through public interest litigation and the application of consumer protection laws.
