Of course. Let's proceed to the crucial element of causation.

### 3.9 Causation and Remoteness of Damage ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: Causation is the critical link between the defendant's breach and the claimant's harm. Without this link, there is no liability. This is a fundamental and compulsory element of every negligence claim, and the tests for factual causation and legal remoteness are cornerstones of tort law analysis. 🔗

Even if a claimant proves that the defendant owed them a duty of care and breached it, the claim will fail unless they can also prove that the breach **caused** the damage they suffered. The law approaches the issue of causation in two distinct stages: factual causation and legal causation (remoteness).

---

### Part I: Factual Causation

This stage is concerned with establishing the physical link between the defendant's negligence and the claimant's injury as a matter of fact.

**The "But For" Test** The primary test for factual causation is the **"but for" test**. The court asks the question:

> "**But for** the defendant's breach of duty, would the claimant have suffered the harm?"

- If the answer is **"No"** (the harm would _not_ have occurred without the breach), then factual causation is established.
    
- If the answer is **"Yes"** (the harm would have occurred anyway, regardless of the breach), then factual causation is not established, and the claim fails.
    

**The Landmark Case: _Barnett v Chelsea & Kensington Hospital Management Committee (1969)_**

- **Facts**: Three night-watchmen went to a hospital emergency department complaining of vomiting after drinking tea. The doctor on duty, in breach of his duty, failed to examine them and told them to go home and see their own doctors. One of the men died several hours later from arsenic poisoning.
    
- **Ruling**: The court held that the hospital was not liable. Medical evidence showed that even if the man had been admitted and treated with all due care, he would have died anyway because the poison was already too advanced in his system. Therefore, "but for" the doctor's negligence, the man still would have died. The breach did not cause the death.

### Part II: Legal Causation (Remoteness of Damage)

Even if factual causation is established, the law must decide whether it is fair to hold the defendant liable for the harm. This is a policy-based mechanism to limit liability to consequences that are not too far-fetched or "remote" from the original negligent act.

**The Modern Test: Reasonable Foreseeability of the _Type_ of Harm** The old rule—that a defendant was liable for all _direct_ consequences—was replaced by the modern test in the case of **_Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock & Engineering Co Ltd (The Wagon Mound No. 1) [1961]_**.

**The Rule**: A defendant is only liable for damage if the **kind or type of damage** was a **reasonably foreseeable** consequence of their breach.

- **Facts**: The defendants negligently spilled a large amount of furnace oil from their ship into Sydney Harbour. The oil spread to the claimant's wharf, where welding work was being done. Sparks from the welding ignited debris floating on the oil, causing a fire that severely damaged the wharf.
    
- **Ruling**: The defendants were held not liable for the fire damage. The court found that, at the time, damage by fire was not a reasonably foreseeable consequence of spilling this type of oil on water. The specific _type_ of harm was too remote.
    

It is important to note that the **exact way** the damage occurs and the **full extent** of the damage do **not** need to be foreseeable, only the _type_ of damage.

#### An Elaboration: The "Eggshell Skull" Rule

This rule works alongside the remoteness test. The maxim is that the defendant must **"take their victim as they find them"** (_talem qualem_).

**The Rule**: If the _type_ of harm is reasonably foreseeable, the defendant is liable for the full _extent_ of that harm, even if the extent is much greater than expected due to some pre-existing weakness or vulnerability of the claimant.

- **Key Case**: In **_Smith v Leech Brain & Co (1962)_**, a worker suffered a burn on his lip due to his employer's negligence. A burn was a foreseeable type of injury. However, the worker had a pre-cancerous condition, and the burn triggered a terminal cancer from which he died. The employer was held liable for his death. The burn was foreseeable; therefore, the defendant was liable for all the consequences flowing from it, even the unforeseeable extent of the harm.
    

The chain of causation can also be broken by a **new intervening act** (_novus actus interveniens_), which, if unforeseeable, can relieve the original defendant of liability.

The courts in **Bangladesh** apply these established common law principles—the "but for" test and the "reasonable foreseeability" test from _The Wagon Mound_—to determine causation.
