## 📑 **3.9 Causation and Remoteness of Damage**

---

### **📌 Introduction**

Proving negligence isn’t complete without showing that the **breach actually caused the harm**.  
👉 This step has **two parts**:  
1️⃣ **Factual causation** — Did the defendant’s breach **actually cause** the damage?  
2️⃣ **Legal causation (Remoteness)** — Was the damage a **foreseeable consequence**?

---

### ✅ **1️⃣ Factual Causation**

**Key Test:**  
✔ _“But for” Test_ — Would the harm have happened **but for** the defendant’s breach?

**Key Case:**  
**Barnett v Chelsea & Kensington Hospital (1969)** —  
Patient went to hospital with arsenic poisoning; doctor failed to treat him, but he would have died anyway. Held: No factual causation.

---

**Example:**  
If a driver speeds and hits a pedestrian — “But for the speeding, would the accident have happened?”

---

### ✅ **2️⃣ Legal Causation / Remoteness of Damage**

Even if factual causation is clear, the damage must **not be too remote** — it must be a **reasonably foreseeable result** of the breach.

---

**Key Case:**  
**The Wagon Mound (No.1) (1961)** —  
Oil spilled into water, fire caused massive damage. Court held only damage that is **reasonably foreseeable** is recoverable.

---

### ✅ **Thin Skull Rule**

👉 You must “take your victim as you find them.”  
Even if the claimant is unusually vulnerable, the defendant is still fully liable for all resulting harm.

**Key Case:** **Smith v Leech Brain (1962)** —  
Small burn triggered cancer due to pre-existing condition. Held: Defendant liable for full extent.

---

### ✅ **Intervening Acts (Novus Actus Interveniens)**

If a new, independent event breaks the chain of causation, the defendant may not be liable for damage caused **after** that event.

**Example:**

- Doctor treats an injury negligently, worsening it — the doctor’s negligence may break the chain for the original tortfeasor.
    
- Victim acts unreasonably, worsening injury.
    

---

### ✅ **Multiple Causes**

Where there are multiple possible causes:

- Courts look at whether the defendant’s breach **materially contributed** to the harm.
    

**Key Case:** **McGhee v National Coal Board (1973)** —  
Failure to provide washing facilities materially increased risk of dermatitis — breach contributed.

### 📌 **Key Takeaways**

✔ Causation = factual + legal.  
✔ _But for_ test for factual causation.  
✔ Remoteness: damage must be foreseeable.  
✔ Thin Skull Rule: liable for full extent even if unusual.  
✔ Novus actus breaks the chain.  
✔ Use **Barnett**, **Wagon Mound**, **Smith v Leech Brain**.

---

### 📝 **Exam Tip**

✔ Always write both steps: factual + legal.  
✔ Use real cases: **Barnett**, **Wagon Mound**, **Smith v Leech Brain**.  
✔ Mention Thin Skull & intervening acts.
