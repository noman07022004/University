Of course. Let's proceed to the most significant topic in the course: Negligence.

### 3. Negligence ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: Negligence is the modern cornerstone of tort law. It provides a framework for addressing unintentional harm in almost every sphere of human activity, from road accidents to medical errors. A complete mastery of its elements—duty, breach, causation, and remoteness—is absolutely essential for any law student. It is the most frequently and deeply examined topic. ⚖️

Negligence is a tort that protects against harm caused by the carelessness of others. Unlike intentional torts, it does not require a deliberate desire to cause harm. It is defined as the **breach of a legal duty to take care which results in damage to the claimant**. To succeed in a negligence claim, the claimant must prove four distinct elements on the balance of probabilities.

### 1. Element I: Duty of Care (Subtopics 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5)

A claimant must first establish that the defendant owed them a legal duty to take reasonable care. Not every act of carelessness gives rise to a claim; a duty must first exist.

**A. General Principles: The Neighbour Principle and the _Caparo_ Test** The modern concept of the duty of care was born in the landmark case of **_Donoghue v Stevenson (1932)_**. Lord Atkin established the **"neighbour principle"**:

> "You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour. Who, then, in law, is my neighbour? The answer seems to be – persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question."

This principle has been refined into the modern three-stage test from **_Caparo Industries plc v Dickman (1990)_**. For a duty of care to exist, the court must be satisfied that:

1. The harm was **reasonably foreseeable**.
    
2. There was a relationship of **proximity** (legal closeness) between the claimant and defendant.
    
3. It is **fair, just, and reasonable** to impose a duty in the circumstances.
    

**B. Problem Areas in Duty of Care**

- **Omissions (Subtopic 3.4)**: The general rule is that there is no liability for a mere **omission** or a failure to act. The law does not impose a general duty to rescue a stranger. However, a duty to act _is_ imposed in exceptional cases, such as where there is a special relationship (e.g., parent-child), an assumption of responsibility, or where the defendant has created the dangerous situation.
    
- **Acts of Third Parties and Public Authorities (Subtopic 3.5)**: Generally, there is no duty to prevent a third party from causing harm to the claimant. An exception exists where the defendant has a special relationship of control over the third party (e.g., **_Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co Ltd_**, where officers were liable for damage caused by young offenders under their control). **Public authorities** (like the police) are often shielded from owing a duty of care to individuals for policy reasons, such as preventing defensive practices and protecting public funds. In **_Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire (1989)_**, it was held the police did not owe a duty to an individual member of the public to apprehend a serial killer.
    
- **Pure Economic Loss (Subtopic 3.3)**: The law distinguishes between **consequential economic loss** (financial loss resulting from physical injury, which is recoverable) and **pure economic loss** (financial loss with no accompanying physical injury, which is generally _not_ recoverable). This rule exists to prevent the "floodgates" of litigation for an indeterminate amount to an indeterminate class. The major exception is for **negligent misstatement**, established in **_Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd (1964)_**. A duty can arise where there is a "special relationship" of trust, an assumption of responsibility by the advisor, and reasonable reliance by the advisee.

### 2. Element II: Breach of Duty (Subtopics 3.6, 3.7, 3.8)

Once a duty of care is established, the claimant must prove that the defendant **breached** it by failing to meet the required standard of care.

**A. The Standard of Care** The standard is objective: that of the **"reasonable person."** The court asks what a reasonably prudent person would have done in the defendant's position. This standard can be adjusted:

- **Professionals**: Are judged by the standard of a reasonably competent professional in their field. This is the **Bolam Test**.
    
- **Medical Negligence (Subtopic 3.7)**: Under the Bolam test (_Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee [1957]_), a doctor is not negligent if they have acted in accordance with a practice accepted as proper by a responsible body of medical opinion. This has been qualified by the _Bolitho_ test, which adds that the accepted practice must also have a logical basis.
    
- **Learners**: Are judged by the standard of a competent, qualified person. A learner driver is expected to drive like a reasonably qualified driver.
    

To determine if a breach occurred, courts weigh factors like the **probability and severity** of the harm against the **cost of taking precautions** and the **social utility** of the defendant's conduct.

**B. Proof of Negligence (Subtopic 3.8)** The claimant bears the burden of proving the breach. However, in cases where the exact cause of the accident is unknown but it clearly resulted from negligence, the claimant can be assisted by the doctrine of **_res ipsa loquitur_** ("the thing speaks for itself"). If the instrumentality causing the harm was under the defendant's control and the event is one that would not normally occur without negligence, the burden of proof shifts to the defendant to show they were not negligent. The classic case is **_Scott v London & St Katherine Docks (1865)_**, where bags of sugar fell from a warehouse onto the claimant.

### 3. Element III & IV: Causation and Remoteness (Subtopic 3.9)

The claimant must prove that the defendant's breach caused their damage and that the damage was not too remote.

- **Factual Causation**: The primary test is the **"but for" test**: But for the defendant's breach, would the claimant have suffered the harm? In **_Barnett v Chelsea Hospital (1969)_**, a patient who was negligently sent home by a doctor died of arsenic poisoning. The hospital was not liable because evidence showed the patient would have died anyway, even with proper treatment. The doctor's negligence was not the "but for" cause of death.
    
- **Legal Causation (Remoteness)**: Even if factual causation is proven, the damage must not be too remote a consequence of the breach. The test, from **_The Wagon Mound (No. 1) [1961]_**, is whether the **type of damage** was **reasonably foreseeable**. The exact manner in which the damage occurred or its full extent does not need to be foreseeable. This brings in the **"eggshell skull" rule**: the defendant must take their victim as they find them. If the _type_ of injury was foreseeable (e.g., a burn), the defendant is liable for the full _extent_ of that injury, even if it is unexpectedly severe due to the claimant's pre-existing vulnerability.

### 4. Defenses to Negligence (Subtopic 3.10)

Even if all four elements are proven, a defendant may have a defense:

- **_Volenti non fit injuria_** **(Consent)**: The claimant voluntarily accepted the risk of harm. This is a complete defense but is difficult to establish.
    
- **Contributory Negligence**: The claimant's own carelessness contributed to their injuries. This is a **partial defense**. A court will apportion blame and reduce the claimant's damages accordingly.
    
- **Illegality (_Ex Turpi Causa_)**: The claimant was injured while engaged in an illegal activity. This can be a complete defense.
    

In **Bangladesh**, these fundamental principles of negligence, derived from English common law, are applied by the courts. The growing number of cases involving medical negligence and road accidents highlights the doctrine's immense practical importance in the country.
