Of course. Let's break down the general principles of negligence.

### 3.1 General Principles ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: These principles form the essential framework for the entire tort of negligence. They are the building blocks of every negligence claim, and you will apply this four-part structure to every problem question you encounter. Mastering this is non-negotiable. 🏗️

The modern tort of negligence is not simply about carelessness. It is a distinct cause of action with a specific structure. Initially, "negligence" was merely a state of mind, a way in which other torts could be committed. However, the landmark case of **_Donoghue v Stevenson (1932)_** established negligence as an independent tort.

The classic definition of negligence was provided by Baron Alderson in **_Blyth v Birmingham Waterworks Co. (1856)_**:

> "Negligence is the omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided upon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do, or doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do."

To succeed in a negligence claim, a claimant must prove four essential elements. These principles form the skeleton of the tort, and a failure to establish any one of them will cause the entire claim to collapse.

### The Four Core Principles of a Negligence Claim

**1. The Existence of a Duty of Care** The first principle is that the defendant must have owed the claimant a legal **duty of care**. It is not enough to show that the defendant was careless in a general sense; the claimant must prove that the defendant had a specific legal obligation to be careful towards them. This duty acts as a control mechanism, limiting the class of people who can bring a claim. The foundational concept for establishing this duty is Lord Atkin's **"neighbour principle,"** which posits that a duty is owed to those who are so closely and directly affected by your actions that you ought to have them in your contemplation.

**2. A Breach of that Duty** The second principle requires the claimant to prove that the defendant's conduct fell below the standard of care required by law. This is the "fault" element of negligence. The standard is not one of perfection but is based on the objective standard of the **"reasonable person."** The court asks: "What would a reasonably prudent person have done in the same circumstances?" If the defendant's actions did not meet this standard, they are in breach of their duty.

**3. Causation of Damage** The third principle is that the defendant's breach must have **caused** the claimant's damage. A claimant cannot succeed by simply showing a breach and damage; they must prove the breach _led to_ the damage. This involves two distinct inquiries:

- **Factual Causation**: The claimant must show that "but for" the defendant's breach, the harm would not have occurred. The breach must be a necessary precondition of the damage.
    
- **Legal Causation (Remoteness)**: The law must also consider the harm to be a sufficiently close consequence of the breach. The damage must not be too **remote**. If an unforeseen, intervening event (_novus actus interveniens_) breaks the chain of causation, the defendant will not be liable.

**4. Legally Recognised Damage** The final principle is that the claimant must have suffered a type of harm that the law recognizes as actionable damage. The tort of negligence is **not** actionable _per se_ (by itself). Unlike trespass, where the violation of the right is enough, a negligence claim requires proof of actual damage. This can include:

- Physical injury to a person.
    
- Damage to property.
    
- Psychiatric injury (in limited circumstances).
    
- Pure economic loss (in very limited circumstances).
    

If there is no damage, or the damage is of a type the law does not protect against, there can be no claim in negligence.

In **Bangladesh**, these four general principles—**Duty, Breach, Causation, and Damage**—are the exact framework applied by the courts, following the precedents of English common law.
