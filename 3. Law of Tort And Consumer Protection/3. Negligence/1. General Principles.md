### **📌 Introduction**

### **📜 Definition**

**Negligence:**  
_As per Winfield & Jolowicz:_  
“Negligence is the breach of a legal duty to take care, which results in damage, undesired by the defendant, to the plaintiff.”

### **📌 Essentials of Negligence**

To claim negligence, a plaintiff must prove **three basic elements**:

---

### **1️⃣ Duty of Care**
