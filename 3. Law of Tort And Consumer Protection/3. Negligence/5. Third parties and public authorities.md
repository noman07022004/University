## 📑 **3.5 Third Parties and Public Authorities**

---

### **📌 Introduction**

When dealing with negligence, it can get tricky if harm is caused **by someone else (a third party)** or if the defendant is a **public authority** (like police or local councils).  
The **general rule** is:  
👉 There’s usually **no duty** to prevent harm caused by others — **unless** special conditions apply.

---

### **📜 Liability for Third Parties**

---

### ✅ **General Rule**

- You are **not normally responsible** for harm caused **by a stranger** or **a third party’s actions**.
    
- Example: A shopkeeper is not usually liable if a random customer attacks another customer — unless there’s a special duty.
    

---

### ✅ **Exceptions: When Duty May Arise**

Courts may find a duty **in special circumstances**:

---

### **1️⃣ Assumption of Responsibility**

- If you **voluntarily agree** to protect someone.
    
    - _Example:_ A security company hired to guard a store.
        

---

### **2️⃣ Control over Third Party**

- If you have **actual control** over the person causing harm.
    
    - _Example:_ A prison’s duty to control prisoners (_Dorset Yacht_).
        

---

### **3️⃣ Creation of Risk**

- If you **create a situation** where third-party acts cause harm.
    
    - _Example:_ A hotel leaves a door unlocked, making theft easier.
        

---

### ✅ **Key Case**

✔ **Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co (1970)**

- Borstal officers failed to supervise boys who escaped and damaged yachts.
    
- Held: Officers had control → owed a duty to yacht owners.
    

---

### **📜 Liability of Public Authorities**

Public bodies (like police, councils, hospitals) owe **duties of care**, but courts are careful because:

- Fear of **opening floodgates** of lawsuits.
    
- Fear of interfering with public policy and decisions.
    

---

### ✅ When Do Public Authorities Owe a Duty?

✔ **If a duty is recognised by law**, they must follow **ordinary negligence principles**.  
✔ They may owe duties for **operational failures**, but not for **policy decisions**.

---

### ✅ **Key Cases**

- **Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire (1989)**
    
    - Police not liable for failing to catch the Yorkshire Ripper sooner — no duty to any one victim.
        
- **Anns v Merton (1978)**
    
    - Local authority liable for negligent building inspection (later restricted by newer cases).
        

---

### ✅ **Modern Approach**

Courts look at:  
1️⃣ Was there **proximity**?  
2️⃣ Was harm **foreseeable**?  
3️⃣ Is it **fair, just, and reasonable** to impose duty? (Caparo test)

---

### ✅ **Examples**

✔ **Fire service:** May not owe a duty to put out every fire, but if they act carelessly during operations → duty arises.  
✔ **Police:** Usually owe duties **to the public at large**, not to individuals — unless they assume responsibility.

### ✅ **Possible Exam Question**

> _“Discuss liability for acts of third parties and the duty of care of public authorities.”_

---

### 📌 **Key Takeaways**

✔ No general duty to prevent harm by third parties.  
✔ Duty arises if there’s control, assumption of responsibility, or creation of risk.  
✔ Public authorities may owe duties for **operational acts**, not **policy choices**.  
✔ Important cases: _Dorset Yacht_, _Hill v Chief Constable_, _Caparo v Dickman_.

---

### 📝 **Exam Tip**

✔ Explain the general rule and exceptions.  
✔ Use _Dorset Yacht_ for third parties.  
✔ Use _Hill_ and _Caparo_ for public bodies.  
✔ Always show **foreseeability + proximity + fairness**.
