Of course. Let's proceed to the next subtopic, which deals with these complex duty of care situations.

### 3.5 Third Parties and Public Authorities ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: This is a highly complex and policy-driven area of the duty of care. It explores the difficult question of when a person or public body is responsible for the actions of others. The principles here are crucial for understanding the limits of negligence and are a common subject of advanced-level essay questions. üèõÔ∏è

This subtopic examines the circumstances in which the law will impose a duty of care on a defendant for harm caused not by their own direct act, but by the actions of a third party, with a special focus on the liability of public authorities.

### Part I: Liability for the Acts of Third Parties

**The General Rule: No Duty** The starting principle is that the law of negligence does not impose a duty on a person to control the actions of a third party. You are not your "brother's keeper." The law is reluctant to make one person responsible for the independent wrongdoing of another, as this would be a severe imposition on individual autonomy.

**Exceptions to the General Rule** However, a duty to protect a claimant from harm caused by a third party _can_ arise where there is a **special relationship** between the defendant and either the third party or the claimant.

**1. A Relationship of Control between the Defendant and the Third Party** A duty of care may be imposed where the defendant has a degree of power, authority, or control over the third party who causes the harm.

- **The Landmark Case**: **_Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co Ltd (1970)_**. Young offenders, who were under the supervision and control of Borstal officers, escaped and caused damage to the claimants' yachts. The House of Lords held that the Home Office (as the employer of the officers) owed a duty of care. The duty arose because the officers had control over the offenders and it was foreseeable that if they were negligent in exercising that control, the offenders would cause this type of damage.
    

**2. An Assumption of Responsibility by the Defendant for the Claimant's Safety** A duty can also arise where the defendant has implicitly or explicitly assumed a responsibility to protect the claimant from harm.

- **Example**: A school has a special relationship with its pupils and assumes responsibility for their safety while on school premises. This includes a duty to take reasonable steps to protect pupils from being harmed by other pupils.

### Part II: Liability of Public Authorities

This is one of the most difficult and policy-laden areas of negligence law. Public authorities (such as the police, fire brigades, social services, and local councils) are established by statute to perform public functions for the collective welfare. The courts have consistently shown great reluctance to impose a common law duty of care on them for failures in the performance of these functions.

**Core Policy Reasons for this Reluctance:**

- **Resource Allocation**: Courts do not want to interfere with the discretionary decisions public authorities must make about how to allocate their limited financial and human resources. Imposing liability might distort these priorities.
    
- **"Defensive Practices"**: The threat of lawsuits could cause public bodies to become overly cautious and bureaucratic, diverting resources from their primary tasks to avoiding liability. This could lead to a worse service for the public overall.
    
- **Floodgates**: Public authorities interact with countless citizens. Imposing a duty could open the floodgates to an unmanageable volume of litigation.
    
- **Alternative Remedies**: Often, the correct way to hold a public body accountable is through public law channels (like judicial review) or the political process, not a private tort claim.
    

**Key Cases Illustrating the Approach:**

- **Police**: In **_Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire (1989)_**, the mother of the final victim of a serial killer sued the police for negligently failing to catch him sooner. The House of Lords held that the police do **not** owe a general duty of care to individual members of the public for failing to apprehend a criminal. The court found there was insufficient proximity, and the policy reasons against imposing such a duty were overwhelming.
    
- **Fire Brigade**: In **_Capital & Counties plc v Hampshire County Council (1997)_**, it was established that a fire brigade does not owe a duty of care to attend a fire or to put it out effectively. However, they **do** owe a duty not to make the situation worse through a positive act of negligence.
    
- **Social Services**: In cases like **_X v Bedfordshire County Council (1995)_**, courts have held that local authorities do not owe a duty of care in negligence for failures to protect children from abuse, again citing powerful public policy reasons.
    

In **Bangladesh**, while there is less specific case law, the courts would be highly influenced by these common law principles. A similar cautious approach would be expected before imposing a duty of care on a public authority for failures in its public functions, especially given that alternative remedies often exist through constitutional or administrative law.
