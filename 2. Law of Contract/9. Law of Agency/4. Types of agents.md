Of course. Let's cover the next subtopic.

### **9.4 Types of agents** ⭐⭐

**Why Not as Critical**: This is a descriptive topic that categorizes different kinds of agents. While it's useful for context and terminology, the core legal principles of agency (authority, duties, liability) apply generally to all types of agents, making this less of an analytical topic.

Agents can be classified based on the scope of their authority or the nature of their work.

#### **1. Classification by Authority**

- **General Agent**: An agent appointed to perform all acts connected with a particular business or trade. They have the authority to do anything that is usual in that line of business.
    
    - **Example**: The manager of a store is a general agent for the store owner. They can purchase stock, hire employees, and conduct sales.
        
- **Special Agent**: An agent appointed to perform a single, specific act or transaction. Their authority is limited to that particular act.
    
    - **Example**: An agent hired to sell a specific house. Their authority ends once the house is sold.
        
- **Universal Agent**: An agent whose authority is unlimited. They are authorized to do all acts that the principal can legally do. This type of agency is very rare.
    

#### **2. Classification by Function**

- **Mercantile Agents**: An agent who has the authority to either sell goods, buy goods, or raise money on the security of goods in the ordinary course of business.
    
    - **Factor**: A mercantile agent who is given possession of the goods and can sell them in their own name.
        
    - **Broker**: A mercantile agent who negotiates contracts for the sale or purchase of goods but does not have possession of them. They act as a middleman.
        
    - **Auctioneer**: An agent who sells goods at a public auction.
        
- **Non-Mercantile Agents**: Agents who are not involved in the buying or selling of goods, such as lawyers, insurance agents, or an agent appointed via a power of attorney to manage property.
