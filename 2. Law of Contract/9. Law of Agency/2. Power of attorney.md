Of course. Let's cover the next subtopic.

### **9.2 Power of attorney** ‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Why Not as Critical**: A power of attorney is a formal instrument for creating an agency, but it's just one method. The broader principles of agency (authority, duties, etc.) apply whether the agency is created by a formal power of attorney or by a simple verbal agreement. It's more about the formality of creation than the substance of the agency itself.

A **Power of Attorney** is a formal, written legal document through which one person (the **principal**) grants another person (the **agent** or **attorney-in-fact**) the authority to act on their behalf.

It is one of the most common ways to create an **express agency**. The document specifies the exact scope of the authority given to the agent.

#### **Nature and Purpose**

- **Formal Evidence**: It serves as conclusive proof of the agent's authority to third parties.
    
- **Governing Law**: In Bangladesh, these instruments are governed by the **Power of Attorney Act, 2012**.
    
- **Registration**: For certain acts, such as selling or mortgaging immovable property, the power of attorney must be registered with the relevant government authority to be legally valid.
    

#### **Types of Power of Attorney**

1. **General Power of Attorney (GPA)** This grants the agent broad powers to act on the principal's behalf in a variety of matters, such as managing finances, handling business transactions, or dealing with property.
    
2. **Special Power of Attorney (SPA)** This grants the agent authority to act only in a specific, named transaction or for a particular purpose.
    
    - **Example**: P gives A a special power of attorney to sell P's car. A's authority is limited _only_ to acts related to selling that specific car. Once the car is sold, the power of attorney's purpose is fulfilled, and the agency for that act terminates. üìÑ
