## **9. Law of Agency** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: The law of agency is fundamental to the entire world of business. Almost all commercial transactions are carried out through agents, from a shop assistant selling goods on behalf of a store owner to a CEO acting on behalf of a corporation. Understanding this relationship is essential for knowing who is liable for the actions of another.

The law of agency is based on the principle **_Qui facit per alium, facit per se_**, which means, "He who acts through another, acts himself." An **agency** is a relationship where one person, the **agent**, is authorized to act on behalf of another, the **principal**, to create a legal relationship between the principal and a third party.

### **Creation and Nature of Agency**

An agency is created when the principal grants authority to the agent. This can be done expressly, often through a formal written document called a **power of attorney**, which specifies the exact powers of the agent. Agency can also be created impliedly by the conduct or relationship between the parties. The true **test of agency** is whether a person has the authority to bind the principal and create a legal relationship with third parties.

The **agent's authority** defines the scope of their power. This can be **actual authority** (expressly given) or **apparent/ostensible authority** (where the principal's conduct leads a third party to believe the agent has authority, even if they don't).

### **Rights, Duties, and Liabilities**

The **principal's duties** are to pay the agent the agreed remuneration and to indemnify them for lawful acts done in the course of the agency. The agent, in turn, has a duty to act according to the principal's directions, exercise reasonable skill and care, and, crucially, not to let their own interests conflict with their duty (a fiduciary duty).

The **liability** for the agent's actions generally falls on the principal. If the agent acts within their authority, the principal is bound to the third party. This includes liability for **misrepresentation and fraud by the agent** if committed in the ordinary course of the agency business.

### **Agents, Sub-agents, and Termination**

There are many **types of agents**, such as brokers, auctioneers, and factors, each with different roles. An agent generally cannot delegate their duties to a **sub-agent**, unless the nature of the work requires it or it is a custom of the trade. If a sub-agent is properly appointed, the principal is bound by their acts.

The agency relationship can be **terminated** in several ways, including by the principal revoking the agent's authority, by the agent renouncing the business, or by the death or insolvency of either party.
