Of course. Let's cover the next subtopic.

### **9.3 Enforcement and consequences** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This topic is the core of agency law. It explains the legal effect of an agent's actions and answers the fundamental question: "Who is bound by the contract?" Understanding these rules is essential for knowing who can sue and who can be sued in a transaction carried out by an agent.

The enforcement and consequences of an agency relationship are governed by a simple but powerful principle laid out in **Section 226 of the Contract Act, 1872**.

#### **The Core Principle**

The rule states that contracts entered into through an agent, and obligations arising from acts done by an agent, can be enforced in the same manner and will have the same legal consequences as if the acts had been done by the **principal in person**.

**In simple terms**:

- When an agent acts **within their authority**, the agent effectively becomes invisible in the eyes of the law.
    
- A direct contractual relationship is created between the **principal** and the **third party**.
    

#### **Consequences for Each Party**

1. **The Principal is Bound** The principal is legally bound by the acts of the agent. They acquire the rights and incur the liabilities of the contract. The principal can sue the third party, and the third party can sue the principal.
    
2. **The Agent is Not Personally Liable** The agent, having acted as a mere intermediary, is not a party to the contract and is generally not personally liable for it, nor can they personally enforce it.
    
3. **The Third Party is Bound to the Principal** The third party's legal relationship is with the principal, not the agent.
    

**Example**

- **Scenario**: P (Principal) authorizes A (Agent) to buy 100 tons of cement from S (Third Party). A enters into a contract with S, making it clear he is acting as an agent for P.
    
- **Consequences**:
    
    - A binding contract is formed between **P and S**.
        
    - P is liable to pay S for the cement.
        
    - S is liable to deliver the cement to P.
        
    - If S fails to deliver, **P must sue S**. A cannot sue S.
        
    - If P fails to pay, **S must sue P**. S cannot sue A.
