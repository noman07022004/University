Of course. Let's cover this next subtopic.

### **9.7 Liability** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This topic addresses the crucial question of "who is legally responsible?" in an agency transaction. It defines the default rule that the principal is liable for the agent's acts and, more importantly, outlines the specific exceptions where the agent can be held personally liable. Understanding these rules is critical for all three parties involved.

The general rule of agency is that the **principal is liable** for all acts of the agent done within the scope of their authority. The agent, acting as a mere intermediary, is not personally liable. However, an agent's personal liability depends heavily on how they represent themselves to the third party.

#### **1. When the Principal is Disclosed**

If an agent, when entering into a contract, discloses that they are acting as an agent and also names their principal, then:

- **The agent is NOT personally liable.**
    
- A direct contract is created between the principal and the third party. This is the standard and most common agency scenario.
    

**Example**: A says to C, "I would like to buy these goods on behalf of P." The contract is between P and C. A has no personal liability.

#### **2. When the Principal is Undisclosed**

An undisclosed principal situation arises when an agent enters into a contract with a third party **without revealing** that they are acting as an agent. The third party believes the agent is the principal.

- **The agent IS personally liable** because they contracted in their own name.
    
- **The Doctrine of Election**: When the third party later discovers the existence of the principal, they have the right to **choose** or **elect** whom to sue. They can sue **either the agent OR the principal**, but not both.
    

**Example**: P asks A to buy some rare books. A goes to a bookstore and buys the books in his own name, without mentioning P. The bookstore can sue A for payment. If the bookstore later finds out P was the principal, they can choose to sue P instead.

#### **3. Agent Acting Without or Beyond Authority**

When a person pretends to be an agent for another, or an actual agent acts beyond their authority, they are personally liable to the third party for what is known as **breach of warranty of authority** (**Section 235**).

- **The Rule**: The agent is liable to compensate the third party for any loss they have suffered by relying on the agent's false claim of authority.
    
- **Example**: A, without any authority from P, purports to sell P's car to C. P is not bound by this contract. C, who may have incurred expenses believing the contract was valid, can sue A personally for the loss.
