Of course. Let's begin the final topic with its first subtopic.

### **9.1 Definition and nature** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: The definition of agency is the starting point for the entire topic. It establishes the three-party relationship (principal-agent-third party) that is the unique feature of agency law. Understanding this core concept and its fiduciary nature is essential for all subsequent subtopics.

#### **Definition**

An **agency** is a legal relationship where one person, the **Agent**, is employed to represent another, the **Principal**, in dealings with **third parties**.

The definitions are given in **Section 182 of the Contract Act, 1872**:

- An **Agent** is a person employed to do any act for another or to represent another in dealings with third persons.
    
- The **Principal** is the person for whom such act is done, or who is so represented.
    

#### **Nature of Agency**

1. **Creation of Legal Relations**: The primary function of an agent is to create a **contractual relationship** between the principal and a third party. The agent acts as a connecting link. When the agent acts within their authority, it is as if the principal had acted themselves.
    
2. **Fiduciary Relationship**: The relationship between a principal and an agent is **fiduciary** in nature. This means it is based on trust and confidence. The agent has a duty to act in the best interests of the principal and must not allow their personal interests to conflict with this duty.
    
3. **Principal Must be Competent**: The principal must be of the age of majority and sound mind to appoint an agent, as they must be competent to contract.
    
4. **Agent May Not Be Competent**: Interestingly, an agent does not need to be competent to contract (**Section 184**). A minor can be an agent. However, the minor agent is not personally liable for their actions to the principal.
    

**Example**: P (Principal) appoints A (Agent) to buy goods from S (a third party). A enters into a contract with S on P's behalf. The legal contract is formed between **P and S**. A is merely a link and is not a party to that final contract.
