### **9.5 Test of agency** ⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: Not every person who acts for another is an agent. This topic is important because it provides the legal test to determine if a true agency relationship exists. Getting this right is crucial because only a true agent can legally bind the principal to third parties.

The true test of an agency is not what the parties call their relationship, but the **substance** of that relationship.

The essential question to ask is:

> **Does the person have the authority to create a legal (contractual) relationship between the principal and a third party?**

If the answer is **yes**, then an agency relationship exists. If the answer is **no**, it is likely another type of relationship, such as master-servant or independent contractor.

#### **Agency vs. Other Relationships**

- **Agent vs. Servant (Employee)**: A servant acts under the direct control and supervision of the master. While a servant can perform acts for the master, they do not typically have the authority to create contracts on the master's behalf with third parties. An agent, however, is primarily a representative. The key difference is the **authority to bind the principal**. For example, a driver (servant) drives the principal's car. An agent can _sell_ the principal's car.
    
- **Agent vs. Independent Contractor**: An independent contractor is hired to perform a specific task but is not under the direct control of the person hiring them. They exercise their own discretion in how the work is done. While an agent can also be an independent contractor, the test remains the same: does the contractor have the authority to represent the principal and form contracts for them? A builder (independent contractor) builds a house. An estate agent (agent) signs a sale agreement for the house on behalf of the principal.
    

**Conclusion**: The defining characteristic and ultimate test of agency is the agent's representative capacity and their power to legally bind the principal in dealings with others.
