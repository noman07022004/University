Of course. Let's cover the next subtopic.

### **9.10 Termination** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: Just as it's crucial to know how an agency is created, it's essential to understand how it ends. Termination releases the principal and agent from their mutual obligations. The rules are important for determining when an agent's authority ceases and who is liable for acts done after that point.

The termination of an agency, governed by **Sections 201-210 of the Contract Act, 1872**, can happen in two main ways: by an act of the parties or by operation of law.

#### **1. Termination by an Act of the Parties**

- **Revocation by the Principal (Section 203)**: The principal can revoke the agent's authority at any time before the authority has been exercised.
    
- **Renunciation by the Agent (Section 201)**: The agent can give up the business of the agency by giving notice to the principal.
    

**Important Note**: If the agency is for a fixed period, the principal may have to compensate the agent for revoking early, and the agent may have to compensate the principal for renouncing early (**Section 205**).

#### **2. Termination by Operation of Law**

The agency is automatically terminated in the following circumstances:

- **Completion of the Business (Section 201)**: When the specific task for which the agency was created is completed, the agency ends.
    
    - **Example**: An agent hired to sell a house. The agency terminates once the sale is complete.
        
- **Expiry of Time**: If the agency was created for a fixed period, it terminates when that period expires.
    
- **Death or Insanity of the Principal or Agent (Section 201)**: The death or insanity of either party automatically terminates the agency.
    
- **Insolvency of the Principal (Section 201)**: The principal being declared insolvent terminates the agency.

#### **Irrevocable Agency**

There is one crucial exception to the principal's right to revoke. An agency is **irrevocable** when the agent has a personal **interest in the subject matter** of the agency (**Section 202**). This is called an "agency coupled with an interest."

- **Example**: P owes money to A. P authorizes A to sell P's land and to pay himself out of the proceeds. P cannot revoke this authority, nor is it terminated by P's death or insanity. This is because A has a personal interest in the land (as a way to recover his debt).
