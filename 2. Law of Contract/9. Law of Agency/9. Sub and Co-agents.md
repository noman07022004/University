Of course. Let's cover the next subtopic.

### **9.9 Sub and Co-agents** ⭐⭐

**Why Not as Critical**: These are more detailed, structural aspects of agency. While important for complex agency chains, the core principles of liability and authority are more fundamental to the subject than the specific rules for delegation.

This topic deals with the delegation of an agent's authority.

#### **1. Sub-Agent (Sections 190-193)**

The general rule is based on the Latin maxim **_Delegatus non potest delegare_**, which means "a delegate cannot further delegate." An agent, being a delegate of the principal, cannot normally delegate their duties to another person.

A **sub-agent** is a person employed by, and acting under the control of, the original agent in the business of the agency.

**When can a sub-agent be appointed?** An agent can only appoint a sub-agent in two situations:

1. If the **ordinary custom of the trade** permits it.
    
2. If the **nature of the agency** requires it.
    

**Consequences of Appointment**:

- **Properly Appointed Sub-agent**: If a sub-agent is properly appointed, the **principal is bound** by the sub-agent's acts, as if the sub-agent were an agent directly appointed by the principal. The original agent is responsible to the principal for the sub-agent's acts.
    
- **Improperly Appointed Sub-agent**: If an agent appoints a sub-agent without proper authority, the principal is not bound by their acts. The **original agent is personally liable** for the sub-agent's acts to both the principal and the third party.

#### **2. Co-Agent**

A **co-agent** is a person who is named by the agent, upon the principal's instruction, to act in the business of the agency. They are not sub-agents. A co-agent is an agent of the **principal**, not the original agent.

- **Example**: P directs his agent, A, to hire a specific, expert lawyer, L, to handle a legal matter related to the agency. L is a co-agent. L is directly responsible to the principal, P. A is not liable for L's actions, as his only duty was to select L as instructed.
