Of course. Let's cover this crucial next subtopic.

### **9.6 Agent's authority** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: The agent's authority is the most critical concept in the law of agency. It defines the scope of the agent's power to bind the principal. A principal is only liable for acts that the agent does within the limits of their authority. Any dispute between a principal and a third party almost always involves a question about the extent of the agent's authority.

The **authority of an agent** is their power to act on behalf of the principal and create a legal relationship between the principal and a third party. This authority can be categorized into two main types.

#### **1. Actual Authority**

This is the authority that the principal has genuinely given to the agent. It can be:

- **Express Authority (Section 187)**: Authority given by words, either spoken or written. This is the clearest form of authority.
    
    - **Example**: The owner of a shop tells the manager, "You have the authority to purchase new stock up to BDT 50,000 per month." This is express authority. A **power of attorney** is a formal document that grants express authority.
        
- **Implied Authority (Section 187)**: Authority that is inferred from the circumstances of the case, the relationship between the parties, or the customs of a particular trade. It includes all lawful things necessary to do the main act.
    
    - **Example**: A person is appointed as the manager of a farm. They have the **implied authority** to do all the necessary acts for managing the farm, such as buying seeds and fertilizer, even if these things were not expressly mentioned in their employment contract.

#### **2. Ostensible or Apparent Authority**

This is not actual authority, but it is the authority that an agent **appears** to have from the perspective of a third party, based on the principal's conduct. If a principal leads a third party to believe that their agent has authority to do something, the principal will be bound by that act, even if the agent had no actual authority.

- **Rationale**: This principle, known as **agency by estoppel**, is designed to protect innocent third parties who rely on the reasonable appearance of authority created by the principal.
    
- **How it arises**: It arises when the principal, by their words or conduct, represents that the agent has authority, and a third party relies on that representation.
    
- **Example**: P has a driver, A, who has been buying petrol for P's car from a specific petrol station on credit for a year, and P has always paid the bills. One day, P tells A not to buy on credit anymore, but does not inform the petrol station. A goes and buys petrol on credit again for his own use. **P is liable** to pay the petrol station. Why? Because P's past conduct created an **apparent authority** in A, and the petrol station reasonably relied on it. P is "estopped" from denying A's authority.
