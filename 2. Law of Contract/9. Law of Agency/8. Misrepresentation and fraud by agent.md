Of course. Let's cover this important subtopic.

### **9.8 Misrepresentation and fraud by agent** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This topic addresses the crucial principle of vicarious liability within an agency context. It explains when a principal, who may be personally innocent of any wrongdoing, is held legally responsible for the misrepresentations or fraudulent acts of their agent. This is a significant area of risk and litigation in all forms of business.

The central question is: If an agent deceives a third party, who is liable? The answer is governed by **Section 238 of the Contract Act, 1872**.

#### **The General Rule: Principal's Liability**

The rule is that misrepresentations made, or frauds committed, by an agent while acting **in the course of his business for his principal**, have the same legal effect on the principal as if they had been done by the principal himself.

**This means:**

- The principal is bound by the agent's misrepresentation.
    
- The principal is liable for the agent's fraud.
    

**The Key Test**: The critical factor is whether the agent's wrongful act was committed **"in the course of the agency business."** It does not matter if the agent was acting for their own personal benefit or if the act was against the principal's express instructions.

**Rationale**: This is an application of the principle of **vicarious liability**. The principal has appointed the agent and put them in a position where they can commit the wrong. Therefore, as between the innocent principal and the innocent third party, the law holds that the principal who empowered the agent should bear the loss.

**Example**:

- **Scenario**: P, the owner of a used car dealership, hires A as a salesman. A, while selling a car to a customer C, fraudulently rolls back the odometer to show a lower mileage. C buys the car relying on this false information.
    
- **Outcome**:
    
    - The fraud was committed by A **in the course of his business** of selling cars for P.
        
    - Therefore, **P is liable** to C for A's fraud.
        
    - C can rescind the contract with P and/or sue P for damages.
        

#### **Agent's Personal Liability**

The fact that the principal is liable does not mean the agent is excused. The agent, as the actual wrongdoer, is always personally liable to the third party for the tort of fraud or deceit. The third party can typically choose to sue the agent, the principal, or both.
