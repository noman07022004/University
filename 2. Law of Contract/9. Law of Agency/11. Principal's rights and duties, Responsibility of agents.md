### **9.11 Principal's rights and duties, Responsibility of agents** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Why Important**: This is the operational core of the agency relationship, outlining the mutual obligations between the principal and the agent. These duties, particularly the agent's fiduciary responsibilities, are the foundation of the trust-based relationship and the source of most internal disputes in an agency.

This topic covers the two sides of the same coin: the duties of the principal (which are the rights of the agent) and the duties of the agent (which are the rights of the principal).

### **Principal's Duties (and Agent's Rights)**

1. **Duty to Remunerate the Agent (Section 219)** The principal must pay the agent the agreed-upon commission or remuneration. If no amount was agreed, the principal must pay what is customary in that line of business. The agent has a **right to receive** this payment.
    
2. **Duty to Indemnify the Agent for Lawful Acts (Section 222)** The principal has a duty to **indemnify** (compensate) the agent for all lawful acts done by the agent in the exercise of their authority.
    
    - **Example**: An agent, on the principal's instruction, buys goods. The principal is bound to pay for them. If the agent has to pay out of their own pocket, the principal must indemnify the agent.
        
3. **Duty to Indemnify for Acts Done in Good Faith (Section 223)** The principal must also indemnify the agent for acts done in good faith, even if those acts end up violating the rights of a third party.
    
    - **Example**: P asks agent A to sell certain goods. A sells them, believing in good faith that P is the owner. Later, it turns out the goods belonged to C. C sues A and recovers damages. P must indemnify A for this loss.

### **Agent's Duties (and Principal's Rights)**

The agent's duties are extensive as the relationship is fiduciary.

1. **Duty to Follow Instructions (Section 211)**: The agent must conduct the business according to the principal's directions.
    
2. **Duty to Act with Reasonable Care and Skill (Section 212)**: The agent must conduct the business with the skill generally possessed by persons in that profession. The agent is liable for any loss caused by their own neglect or lack of skill.
    
3. **Duty to Render Proper Accounts (Section 213)**: The agent must keep accurate accounts of all transactions and provide them to the principal upon demand.
    
4. **Duty to Communicate (Section 214)**: The agent has a duty to communicate with the principal in cases of difficulty and seek their instructions.
    
5. **Duty Not to Delegate Authority**: As discussed, an agent cannot delegate their tasks to a sub-agent unless the trade custom or nature of the work requires it.
    
6. **Duty Not to Make Secret Profits (Fiduciary Duty)**: The agent must not make any secret profit or personal gain from the agency business. All profits must be handed over to the principal.
    
7. **Duty Not to Let Interest Conflict with Duty (Fiduciary Duty)**: The agent cannot act for themselves in the business of the agency. For example, an agent hired to sell a house cannot secretly buy the house for themselves. üè°
