### 📌 2.1 Offer ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

>**Why Important**: The offer is the genesis of any contract. Without a valid offer, there is nothing to accept, and no agreement can be formed. The ability to distinguish a legally binding offer from preliminary negotiations (like an invitation to treat) is a fundamental skill and one of the most frequently examined areas in contract law.

An offer, referred to as a **'proposal'** in the **Contract Act, 1872**, is the starting point of any agreement. Section 2(a) of the Act defines it as:

> _"When one person signifies to another his willingness to do or to abstain from doing anything, with a view to obtaining the assent of that other to such act or abstinence, he is said to make a proposal."_

In simple terms, an offer is a clear, definite promise to be bound by specific terms, provided that the other party accepts those terms.

#### 🟡 Essentials of a Valid Offer

For a proposal to be considered a legally valid offer, it must satisfy several conditions:

1. **Intention to Create Legal Relations**: The offeror must have a genuine intention to be legally bound by the offer. This is assessed objectively—what would a reasonable person believe? A casual promise or a statement made in jest would not qualify.
    
2. **Certain and Unambiguous Terms**: The terms of the offer must be definite. An offer to sell "my house for a reasonable sum" would be too vague. Key terms such as price, subject matter, and quantity must be clear.
    
3. **Communication to the Offeree**: An offer must be communicated to the person to whom it is made. A person cannot accept an offer they are unaware of. The Indian case of **_Lalman Shukla v Gauri Datt_** is a classic illustration: an employee who found his master's missing nephew was not entitled to a reward because he was unaware that a reward had been offered at the time he found the boy.

#### 🟡 Offer vs. Invitation to Treat (ITT)

This distinction is the most critical concept within this topic. Not every communication that invites a response is an offer. An **invitation to treat** is a preliminary step, an invitation to others to make an offer.

|**Invitation to Treat (ITT)**|**Offer**|
|---|---|
|An invitation for others to make offers.|A definite promise to be bound on specific terms.|
|The response is an **offer**.|The response is an **acceptance**.|
|The person making the ITT is **not** bound to accept.|The person making the offer **is** bound if it's accepted.|
|**Examples**: Goods in a shop, ads, menus, auction calls.|**Example**: "I will sell you this specific book for BDT 500."|

**Common Examples of Invitations to Treat:**

- **Display of Goods for Sale**: Goods displayed in a shop, even with a price tag, are not an offer. They are an ITT. The customer makes the offer by taking the goods to the cashier. The shopkeeper then accepts the offer by processing the payment. The leading case is **_Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v Boots Cash Chemists [1953]_**. This rule protects shopkeepers from being legally obliged to sell goods they may have run out of.
    
- **Advertisements**: Generally, an advertisement in a newspaper or on television is an ITT, not an offer (_Partridge v Crittenden [1968]_). It invites the public to come forward and make offers.

#### 🟡 Types of Offers

- **General Offer**: An offer made to the public at large. It can be accepted by anyone who performs the stipulated conditions.
    
- **Unilateral Offer**: This is a specific type of general offer where one party makes a promise in exchange for an act by the other party. The most famous case is **_Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. [1893]_**.
    
    - **Facts**: The Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. advertised that they would pay £100 to anyone who used their product as directed and still contracted influenza. They deposited £1,000 in a bank to show their sincerity. Mrs. Carlill used the ball but got the flu and sued for the £100.
        
    - **Held**: The court found that the advertisement was **not** a mere ITT but a **unilateral offer** to the world. Mrs. Carlill had accepted the offer by performing the conditions (using the smoke ball). The company's deposit of money showed a clear intention to be bound.
        
- **Specific Offer**: An offer made to a specific person or group. Only that person or a member of that group can accept.
    
- **Cross Offer**: When two parties make identical offers to each other without knowing about the other's offer. For example, A emails B to sell his watch for BDT 5,000, and at the same time, B emails A to buy the same watch for BDT 5,000. No contract is formed because there is no acceptance, just two simultaneous offers.
