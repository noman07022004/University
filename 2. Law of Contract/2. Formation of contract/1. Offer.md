## 📑 **2.1 Offer**

---

### **Introduction**

The first step in forming a contract is a **lawful offer**. Without an offer, there can be no acceptance — and without acceptance, no contract. The law sets clear rules about what an offer is, how it should be made, and when it is valid.

---

### **Definition**

- According to **Section 2(a)** of the **Indian Contract Act, 1872**, _“when one person signifies to another his willingness to do or abstain from doing anything, with a view to obtaining the assent of that other, he is said to make a proposal.”_
    
- Here, the word _proposal_ means the same as _offer_.
    

---

### **Essentials of a Valid Offer**

For an offer to be legally valid, it must meet these conditions:

---

### **1️⃣ Must be Made with Intention to Obtain Assent**

- The offer must show clear willingness to be bound by acceptance.
    
- Mere expression of intention to negotiate is not an offer.
    

**Example:**  
A says, _“I may sell my car if I get a good price.”_ — This is not an offer, only a willingness to negotiate.

---

### **2️⃣ Must be Communicated**

- An offer must be communicated to the offeree.
    
- A person cannot accept an offer they do not know about.
    

**Example:**  
A finds B’s lost dog and returns it without knowing about B’s reward offer — A cannot claim the reward because there was no communicated offer.

---

### **3️⃣ Terms Must be Certain and Unambiguous**

- The terms must be clear and definite.
    
- Vague offers cannot be enforced.
    

**Example:**  
A says, _“I will sell you some oil at a reasonable price.”_ — This is vague. But, _“I will sell you 100 litres of mustard oil at Tk. 150 per litre.”_ — This is certain.

---

### **4️⃣ Offer May be Conditional**

- An offer can include conditions which must be fulfilled for acceptance.
    

**Example:**  
A offers to sell his land if B pays within one month. B must accept with this condition.

---

### **5️⃣ No Contract Before Acceptance**

- An offer creates no legal rights by itself.
    
- It only becomes a contract when accepted properly.
    

---

### **Types of Offers**

---

### **1️⃣ Express and Implied Offer**

- **Express Offer:** Clearly stated in words (spoken or written).
    
    - _Example:_ A letter offering to sell a car.
        
- **Implied Offer:** Inferred from conduct or circumstances.
    
    - _Example:_ A bus stopping at a bus stop implies an offer to carry passengers.
        

---

### **2️⃣ Specific and General Offer**

- **Specific Offer:** Made to a definite person or group.
    
    - _Example:_ A offers to sell his bike to B.
        
- **General Offer:** Made to the public at large.
    
    - _Example:_ A company promises to pay Tk. 5,000 to anyone who uses its smoke ball as directed and still gets flu (like _Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co._).
        

---

### **Invitation to Offer vs. Offer**

- An **invitation to offer** is _not_ an offer — it is an invitation for others to make an offer.
    
- Examples: Displaying goods in a shop window, advertisements, auction notices.
    

**Example:**  
A price tag in a store is not an offer. When a customer picks up the product and offers to pay, _that_ is the offer.

---

### **Legal Rules for Valid Offer**

✔ Must be communicated clearly.  
✔ Must not contain hidden terms.  
✔ Cannot bind the offeree to reject it.  
✔ Must be capable of creating legal relationship when accepted.

---

### **Relevant Case**

**Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. (1893)** — A company advertised that it would pay £100 to anyone who used its product and still got flu. The court held this was a valid general offer to the public.

---

### **Conclusion**

A valid offer is the starting point for forming a contract. If an offer is not properly made, communicated, or clear, no valid acceptance can follow — and no contract is formed.

---

### ✅ **Possible Exam Question**

> _“What is an offer? Explain the essentials of a valid offer with examples.”_

---

### 📌 **Tip**

When writing about offer, always:  
✔ Quote **Section 2(a)**.  
✔ Explain _invitation to offer_.  
✔ Give simple, real-life examples.  
✔ Mention at least one famous case like _Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co._

---

### ✏️ **Key Takeaways**

✔ Offer is a proposal made with intention to get acceptance (**Section 2(a)**).  
✔ Must be communicated, certain, and capable of acceptance.  
✔ Express or implied, general or specific.  
✔ An invitation to offer is _not_ an offer.  
✔ A valid offer is the first step towards a binding contract.
