## üìå 2.4 Consideration ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: Consideration is the lifeblood of a contract. It is the legal concept of 'value' that distinguishes a legally enforceable bargain from a mere gratuitous (gift) promise. Along with offer and acceptance, it forms the holy trinity of contract formation. Without valid consideration, an agreement is generally not a contract at all. This is a conceptually vital and heavily examined topic.

Consideration is the "price" that one party pays for the other party's promise or act. It is founded on the principle of reciprocity, best captured by the Latin maxim **_quid pro quo_** ("something for something"). It ensures that a contract is a two-way street, not a one-way gift.

The **Contract Act, 1872**, in Section 2(d), provides a comprehensive definition:

> _"When, at the desire of the promisor, the promisee or any other person has done or abstained from doing, or does or abstains from doing, or promises to do or to abstain from doing, something, such act or abstinence or promise is called a consideration for the promise."_

This definition lays the groundwork for the essential rules of consideration.

### üü° The Essential Rules of Consideration

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Consideration Must Move at the Desire of the Promisor 
An act or promise can only be valid consideration if it is done at the request of the person making the promise (the promisor). An act done voluntarily, without any preceding request, cannot form good consideration for a subsequent promise.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Consideration May Be Past, Present, or Future 
This is a key area where the law in Bangladesh (under the Contract Act) differs from traditional English common law. The language of Section 2(d) explicitly recognizes all three tenses:

- **Past Consideration ("has done or abstained")**: This is an act performed _before_ the promisor made their promise. For example, if your friend voluntarily helps you move into a new apartment, and a week later you gratefully promise to pay them BDT 2,000 for their help, that promise is enforceable in Bangladesh. The past act of helping is valid consideration. (Note: In English law, past consideration is generally not valid).
    
- **Present Consideration ("does or abstains")**: Also known as executed consideration. Here, the act and the promise are simultaneous. The most common example is a cash sale: you pay the price (your consideration) at the same time the shopkeeper gives you the goods (their consideration).
    
- **Future Consideration ("promises to do or abstain")**: Also known as executory consideration. This is a promise in exchange for a promise. For example, a builder promises to construct a house by December, and the owner promises to pay upon completion. This is the basis of most bilateral contracts.
    

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Consideration Need Not Be Adequate, but Must Be of Some Value 
The courts will not inquire into the fairness or adequacy of the consideration. Freedom of contract means parties are free to make their own bargains, whether good or bad. Selling a house worth BDT 1 crore for BDT 10 is perfectly valid, as long as there is no evidence of fraud or duress.

However, the consideration must be **real** and have _some_ value in the eyes of the law. It cannot be physically impossible, legally impossible, or completely illusory (e.g., a promise to pay for magical services).

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Performance of a Pre-Existing Duty is Generally Not Good Consideration 
This is a more complex rule. If a party is already legally bound to perform a duty, simply promising to perform that same duty is not fresh consideration for a new promise.

- **Existing Public Duty**: A police officer cannot claim a reward for arresting a criminal, as this is already their public duty.
    
- **Existing Contractual Duty**: The classic case is **_Stilk v Myrick (1809)_**. Two sailors deserted a ship mid-voyage. The captain promised the remaining crew extra wages to sail the ship home. The court held the crew was not entitled to the extra pay because they were already contractually bound to do whatever was necessary in an emergency. They had not provided any _new_ consideration for the captain's promise.
    
- **Modern Exception**: The rule has been softened by cases like **_Williams v Roffey Bros (1991)_**, which established that if the promisor gains a **"practical benefit"** from the promisee's continued performance, this can be treated as valid consideration. This is a significant modern development.
