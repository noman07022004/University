## 📑 **2.4 Consideration**

---

### **Introduction**

**Consideration** is one of the **most important elements** of a valid contract.  
It is the **price** for which the promise of the other party is bought — in simple words, _something in return_.  
A contract **without consideration is generally void** under the Indian Contract Act, 1872.

---

### **Definition**

According to **Section 2(d)** of the **Indian Contract Act, 1872**:  
_"When, at the desire of the promisor, the promisee or any other person has done or abstained from doing, or does or abstains from doing, or promises to do or abstain from doing something, such act or abstinence or promise is called a consideration for the promise."_

### **Key Features of Consideration**

---

### ✅ **1️⃣ Must Move at the Desire of Promisor**

- Consideration must be given **at the promisor’s desire**, not voluntarily or by a third party without request.
    

**Example:**  
A finds B’s lost wallet and returns it without B’s request. This is not consideration — it is voluntary.

---

### ✅ **2️⃣ May Move from Promisee or Any Other Person**

- It can come from the promisee or even a third party.
    
- This is called the **Doctrine of Privity of Consideration** — unique to Indian law.
    

**Example:**  
A promises to pay B Tk. 1,000 if C delivers goods to A. C delivers — valid consideration even though C is not the promisee.

---

### ✅ **3️⃣ Past, Present, or Future**

- Consideration may be **past, present, or future**.
    

**Past:** Something already done at the promisor’s desire.  
**Present (Executed):** Something done at the time of promise.  
**Future (Executory):** Promise to do or abstain in future.

**Example:**

- **Past:** A saves B’s house from fire at B’s request. Later, B promises Tk. 5,000.
    
- **Present:** A sells a book to B and B pays immediately.
    
- **Future:** A promises to deliver goods next week, B promises to pay on delivery.

### ✅ **4️⃣ Must be Real and Lawful**

- Consideration must have some value in the eyes of law.
    
- It must not be **illegal**, **immoral**, or **impossible**.
    

**Example:**  
A promises to pay B Tk. 10,000 if B steals a bike — unlawful consideration.

---

### ✅ **5️⃣ Need Not be Adequate**

- The law does not require consideration to be equal or fair — but it must be something of value.
    

**Example:**  
A sells a watch worth Tk. 5,000 for Tk. 500. It is still valid if freely agreed.

---

### **When is an Agreement Without Consideration Valid?**

**Section 25** provides exceptions — an agreement **without consideration is valid if:**

1️⃣ It is made out of **natural love and affection** — between near relatives, in writing, registered.  
2️⃣ It is a **promise to compensate** for past voluntary service done at promisor’s desire.  
3️⃣ It is a **promise to pay a time-barred debt** — must be in writing and signed by debtor.

**Example:**

- A father promises in writing to give Tk. 1 lakh to his daughter out of love and affection — valid.
    
- A promises to pay B Tk. 2,000 for saving A’s child from drowning — valid.
    
- A owes B Tk. 10,000, debt is barred by limitation. A signs a written promise to pay — valid.

### **Relevant Case**

**Currie v Misa (1875)** — Defined consideration as _“some right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss, or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other.”_

---

### **Conclusion**

Consideration is the **backbone of a valid contract** — no consideration means no contract, unless covered by specific exceptions under **Section 25**.
