### üìå 2.2 Acceptance ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: Acceptance is the spark that brings a contract to life. It is the moment an offer is converted into a binding promise. The rules governing acceptance are strict and precise because they determine the exact point at which a legal obligation is created. This topic is a cornerstone of contract law and is heavily featured in examinations.

Acceptance is the final and unconditional assent to all the terms of an offer. It is the affirmative response to a proposal that creates the agreement. Section 2(b) of the **Contract Act, 1872**, defines it as follows:

> _"When the person to whom the proposal is made signifies his assent thereto, the proposal is said to be accepted. A proposal, when accepted, becomes a promise."_

For an acceptance to be valid and effective, it must adhere to several cardinal rules.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Acceptance Must Be Absolute and unconditional (The 'Mirror Image' Rule)

The acceptance must be an unequivocal agreement to the exact terms of the offer without any changes or conditions. It must be a "mirror image" of the offer.

- **Counter-Offer**: If the offeree's response alters the terms of the offer, it is not an acceptance but a **counter-offer**. A counter-offer kills the original offer, which cannot be revived or accepted later.
    
    - **Case Law**: In **_Hyde v Wrench (1840)_**, Wrench offered to sell his farm for ¬£1,000. Hyde responded by offering to buy it for ¬£950. Wrench rejected this. Hyde then tried to accept the original ¬£1,000 offer. The court held that no contract existed because Hyde's ¬£950 counter-offer had terminated Wrench's original offer.
        
- **Request for Information**: This must be distinguished from a counter-offer. A mere request for clarification or more information does not destroy the original offer. For example, asking "Is delivery included?" is not a counter-offer.
    

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Acceptance Must Be Communicated

The general rule is that acceptance is not effective until it has been communicated to the offeror. A mental decision to accept is not enough; there must be some external manifestation of assent.

- **Silence**: An offeror cannot impose a contract by stating that the offeree's silence will amount to acceptance.
    
    - **Case Law**: In **_Felthouse v Bindley (1862)_**, an uncle offered to buy his nephew's horse, stating, "If I hear no more about him, I consider the horse mine at that price." The nephew did not reply but intended to sell. The court held there was no contract because acceptance (the nephew's intention) had not been communicated to the offeror (the uncle).
        

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ The Postal Acceptance Rule (Exception to Communication Rule)

This is a crucial exception to the general rule that acceptance must be received to be effective.

- **The Rule**: Where the post is a reasonable and contemplated means of communication, acceptance is complete and the contract is formed **at the moment the letter of acceptance is properly posted**, even if it gets delayed or lost and never reaches the offeror (_Adams v Lindsell (1818)_).
    
- **Rationale**: This rule was developed for commercial convenience, creating a definite point of contract formation and placing the risk of postal issues on the offeror who initiated the process.
    
- **Position in Bangladesh (Contract Act, 1872)**: The Act provides a more nuanced rule in **Section 4**. The communication of acceptance is complete:
    
    - **As against the Proposer (Offeror)**: When the letter of acceptance is posted.
        
    - **As against the Acceptor (Offeree)**: When the letter of acceptance reaches the offeror.
        
    - **Practical Effect**: This unique rule means the offeror is bound as soon as the letter is sent. However, the offeree is not bound until the letter arrives. This allows the offeree to revoke their acceptance by a faster means of communication (e.g., a phone call or email) before the posted letter is delivered.
        

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Acceptance in Instantaneous Communications

For modern, instantaneous methods of communication like telephone, telex, and email, the postal rule **does not** apply. The general rule of communication applies: acceptance is only effective when and where it is **received** by the offeror (_Entores Ltd v Miles Far East Corporation [1955]_).

In essence, acceptance is the clear, communicated, and unqualified "yes" that concludes the bargain and creates a legally binding contract.
