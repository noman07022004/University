## 📑 **2.2 Acceptance**

---

### **Introduction**

Once an offer is made, it must be **accepted** to create an agreement.  
**Acceptance** is the **expression of assent** by the offeree to the terms of the offer.  
Without valid acceptance, an offer cannot become a contract — no matter how clear the offer is.

---

### **Definition**

- According to **Section 2(b)** of the **Indian Contract Act, 1872**:  
    _“When the person to whom the proposal is made signifies his assent thereto, the proposal is said to be accepted.”_
    
- A proposal, when accepted, becomes a **promise**.

### **Legal Rules of a Valid Acceptance**

---

### **1️⃣ Acceptance Must be Absolute and Unqualified**

- Acceptance must match the offer exactly — no conditions or variations.
    
- If the offeree changes the terms, it is a **counter-offer**, not acceptance.
    

**Example:**  
A offers to sell a car for Tk. 3 lakh. B says, _“I will buy it for Tk. 2.5 lakh.”_ — This is a counter-offer, not acceptance.

---

### **2️⃣ Must be Communicated**

- Acceptance must be communicated to the offeror.
    
- Silence does not amount to acceptance.
    

**Example:**  
A writes to B, _“If I don’t hear from you in 7 days, I will assume you accept.”_  
If B stays silent, there is no acceptance.

---

### **3️⃣ Must be Given in Prescribed Manner**

- If the offeror prescribes a mode of acceptance, it must be accepted in that manner.
    
- If no mode is prescribed, it should be done in a usual and reasonable way.
    

**Example:**  
A offers by letter and says, _“Send acceptance by email only.”_ — If B sends a letter instead, A can reject it if he informs B within reasonable time.

---

### **4️⃣ Must be Given Within Specified or Reasonable Time**

- If an offer specifies a time limit, acceptance must be within that time.
    
- If no time is fixed, it must be within reasonable time.
    

**Example:**  
A offers to sell goods valid for 10 days. B accepts on the 12th day — too late, no contract.

---

### **5️⃣ Acceptance Must be by the Person to Whom Offer is Made**

- Only the person to whom the offer is made can accept it.
    

**Example:**  
If A offers to sell his bike to B, only B can accept. C cannot accept on B’s behalf without authority.

---

### **6️⃣ Cannot be Imposed by Offeror**

- The offeror cannot say acceptance will be assumed if the offeree stays silent.
    

**Example:**  
A writes, _“If I don’t hear ‘no’, I will assume you accept buying my car.”_ — Silence is not acceptance.

---

### **Communication Rules: When is Acceptance Complete?**

**Section 4** — The communication of acceptance is complete:

- **As against the proposer (offeror)** — when it is put in a course of transmission to him.
    
- **As against the acceptor** — when it comes to the knowledge of the proposer.
    

**Example:**  
A mails an offer to B. B posts a letter of acceptance.

- As soon as B posts the letter, acceptance is complete against A.
    
- It is complete against B when A receives it.
    

---

### **Revocation of Acceptance**

**Section 5** — Acceptance can be revoked before the communication of acceptance is complete **as against the acceptor**.

**Example:**  
B sends a letter of acceptance but telegraphs A to cancel it — if A receives the revocation before the acceptance letter, revocation is valid.

---

### **Relevant Case**

**Felthouse v Bindley (1862)** — A nephew did not respond to an uncle’s offer to buy his horse, thinking silence was enough. The court held silence does not amount to acceptance.

---

### **Conclusion**

Acceptance transforms an offer into a legally binding promise. If acceptance is defective, the contract does not come into existence, even if the offer is perfect.

### 📌 **Tip**

Always:  
✔ Quote **Section 2(b)** for the definition.  
✔ Mention the rules under **Sections 4 and 5** (communication and revocation).  
✔ Use _Felthouse v Bindley_ as a classic case for “Silence is not acceptance.”

---

### ✏️ **Key Takeaways**

✔ Acceptance must be absolute, unconditional, and communicated.  
✔ Must be given in proper mode and within time.  
✔ Communication rules: complete when put in transmission (against offeror) and when received (against acceptor).  
✔ Revocation is possible before acceptance reaches the proposer.  
✔ Silence is not acceptance.
