## 📑 **2.8 Free Consent**

---

### **Introduction**

Even if an agreement has **offer, acceptance, lawful consideration, and lawful object**, it still won’t form a valid contract unless the parties have given their **consent** — and that consent must be **free**.  
Free consent is vital because the **law respects only voluntary agreements**, not those made by force, fraud, or mistake.

---

### **Definition of Consent**

According to **Section 13** of the **Indian Contract Act, 1872**:  
_"Two or more persons are said to consent when they agree upon the same thing in the same sense."_

This means both parties must understand and agree to the **same subject matter** in the **same way**.

---

### **Definition of Free Consent**

**Section 14** defines _free consent_ as:  
*"Consent is said to be free when it is not caused by —

1. coercion,
    
2. undue influence,
    
3. fraud,
    
4. misrepresentation, or
    
5. mistake."*
    

If consent is not free, the contract is generally **voidable** at the option of the party whose consent was not free.

### ✅ **When Consent is Not Free**

Let’s understand each factor that makes consent _not free_.

---

### **1️⃣ Coercion (Section 15)**

**Meaning:** Forcing someone to enter into a contract by committing or threatening to commit an illegal act or unlawfully detaining property.

**Example:**  
A threatens to kill B if B does not sell his land — B signs under threat → consent obtained by coercion → voidable.

---

### **2️⃣ Undue Influence (Section 16)**

**Meaning:** When one party dominates the will of the other and uses that position to get an unfair advantage.

Common in relationships: parent-child, doctor-patient, teacher-student, lawyer-client.

**Example:**  
A sick patient under complete trust signs away property to his doctor → undue influence → voidable.

---

### **3️⃣ Fraud (Section 17)**

**Meaning:** When one party intentionally deceives the other by:

- Suggesting false facts,
    
- Actively concealing facts,
    
- Promising without intending to perform,
    
- Any act fitted to deceive.
    

**Example:**  
A sells a horse to B saying it’s healthy, knowing it’s lame → fraud → contract voidable.

---

### **4️⃣ Misrepresentation (Section 18)**

**Meaning:** Innocent but false representation made without intention to deceive, but which misleads the other party.

**Example:**  
A seller innocently says a car runs 20 km/litre, but it runs only 10 km/litre → misrepresentation → voidable.

---

### **5️⃣ Mistake (Sections 20–22)**

**Meaning:** An error about an essential fact of the contract.

- **Bilateral Mistake (Section 20):** Both parties misunderstand → void.
    
- **Unilateral Mistake (Section 22):** One party is mistaken → generally not void.
    

**Example (Bilateral):**  
A agrees to sell a ship thinking it’s in the dock, B agrees to buy thinking so too — but ship already sunk → contract void.

---

### **Effect of Absence of Free Consent**

- If consent is caused by **coercion, undue influence, fraud, or misrepresentation**, the contract is **voidable** at the option of the aggrieved party.
    
- If caused by **mistake of fact (bilateral)**, the contract is **void**.
    
- If caused by **mistake of law**, the contract is valid (everyone is expected to know the law).
    

---

### **Relevant Cases**

**Chikkam Ammiraju v Chikkam Seshamma (1917)** — A threatened suicide to make his wife sign away property → coercion → voidable.

---

### **Conclusion**

**Free consent** ensures that contracts are made by choice, not by fear or cheating.  
A contract without free consent is **not validly formed** under law.

### 📌 **Tip**

✔ Quote **Sections 13 & 14** for definition.  
✔ Remember the five factors: coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation, mistake.  
✔ Link each factor to the correct section and give a small example.

### ✏️ **Key Takeaways**

✔ Consent = agreeing on same thing in same sense (**Section 13**).  
✔ Consent must be free — not caused by coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation, or mistake (**Section 14**).  
✔ Absence of free consent → contract is voidable or void depending on reason.  
✔ Free consent = real willingness = valid contract.
