### üìå 2.8 Free consent ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: This topic is the moral and ethical core of contract law. The entire basis of a contract is a voluntary agreement‚Äîa "meeting of the minds." If a party's consent is not freely given, the agreement is tainted at its source. Understanding the factors that vitiate (spoil) consent is essential, as they render a contract 'voidable', giving the innocent party a powerful right to escape the bargain.

For a contract to be valid and binding, there must not only be consent, but that consent must also be _free_.

- **Consent** is defined in **Section 13** of the Contract Act, 1872: Two or more persons are said to consent when they agree upon the same thing in the same sense (_consensus ad idem_).
    
- **Free Consent** is defined in **Section 14**. This section states that consent is free when it is not caused by one of five vitiating factors.
    

If consent is obtained through any of these factors, the contract is generally **voidable** at the option of the party whose consent was so caused. This means the aggrieved party can either choose to cancel the contract or to go ahead with it.

#### üü° The Five Vitiating Factors of Consent

##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Coercion (Section 15) 
Coercion is the crudest method of obtaining consent. It involves illegitimate pressure, typically in the form of physical threats. It is defined as committing, or threatening to commit, any act forbidden by the Penal Code, or unlawfully detaining property, to force a person into an agreement.

- **Essence**: Physical compulsion or threats.
    
- **Example**: A threatens to harm B's child if B does not sell his house to A for a very low price. B's consent has been obtained by coercion.
    

##### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Undue Influence (Section 16) 
This is a more subtle form of pressure. It occurs where one party is in a position to dominate the will of the other due to a pre-existing relationship of trust and confidence, and uses that position to gain an unfair advantage.

- **Essence**: Mental or moral pressure, not physical.
    
- **Relationships**: The law presumes undue influence can exist in relationships of real or apparent authority (e.g., police officer and accused) or fiduciary relationships (e.g., doctor and patient, lawyer and client, spiritual advisor and devotee).
    
- **Example**: An elderly, frail man, who is entirely dependent on his caregiver, is persuaded by the caregiver to sign a contract transferring all his property to her. A court would likely presume this was due to undue influence.
    

##### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Fraud (Section 17) 
Fraud is, simply put, intentional deception. It is a false representation made knowingly, or without belief in its truth, with the intent to induce another party to enter into a contract.

- **Essence**: Deliberate dishonesty.
    
- **Key Acts**: This includes suggesting a fact as true when you know it's false, actively concealing a known defect, or making a promise with no intention of ever performing it.
    
- **Example**: A sells a motorcycle to B, knowing the engine is cracked. A skillfully paints over the crack to hide it. This is **active concealment** and amounts to fraud.
    

##### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Misrepresentation (Section 18) 
Misrepresentation is a false statement of a material fact that induces a party to enter a contract. The crucial difference between misrepresentation and fraud is the **intention**.

- **Essence**: An innocent false statement. The person making the statement believes it to be true, but it is not.
    
- **Example**: A wants to sell his car and honestly tells B that the car has a mileage of 20 km/litre, based on what the previous owner told him. In reality, the car only gets 15 km/litre. A did not intend to deceive B. This is misrepresentation.
    

##### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Mistake (Sections 20, 21, 22) 
A mistake is an erroneous belief about a matter of fact or law. The legal effect of a mistake depends on its type.

- **Bilateral Mistake (Section 20)**: When **both** parties are mistaken about a fact essential to the agreement, the agreement is **void**. (e.g., both parties are unaware that the subject matter of the contract, a specific cargo ship, has already sunk).
    
- **Unilateral Mistake (Section 22)**: When only **one** party is mistaken, the contract is generally **valid**. The law does not protect people from their own carelessness.
    
- **Mistake of Law (Section 21)**: A mistake about a law in force in Bangladesh does not make a contract voidable. Ignorance of the law is no excuse.
