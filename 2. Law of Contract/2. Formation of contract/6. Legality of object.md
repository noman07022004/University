## 📑 **2.6 Legality of Object**

---

### **Introduction**

For an agreement to become a valid **contract**, it must have a **lawful object** _and_ lawful consideration.  
The **object** means the **purpose or design** of the agreement.  
Even if the consideration is lawful, if the **object** (purpose) is illegal, the contract is **void**.

---

### **Legal Basis**

**Section 23** of the **Indian Contract Act, 1872** governs both:

- **Legality of Consideration**, and
    
- **Legality of Object**.
    

---

### **Definition**

An agreement is void if its **object**:

- Is **forbidden by law**,
    
- Defeats the provisions of law,
    
- Is fraudulent,
    
- Causes injury to person or property,
    
- Is immoral,
    
- Is opposed to public policy.
    

(_Same grounds as unlawful consideration._)

### ✅ **Examples of Unlawful Object**

---

### **1️⃣ Object Forbidden by Law**

**Example:**  
A agrees to sell banned wildlife skins to B.  
Object = illegal wildlife trade → forbidden by law → void.

---

### **2️⃣ Object Defeats Law**

**Example:**  
A agrees to pay B Tk. 50,000 to avoid paying lawful taxes.  
Purpose = tax evasion → defeats tax law → void.

---

### **3️⃣ Fraudulent Object**

**Example:**  
A borrows money from B to bribe a public official.  
Bribery is fraud on the public → void.

---

### **4️⃣ Injurious Object**

**Example:**  
A hires B to assault C.  
Purpose = bodily harm → injury → void.

---

### **5️⃣ Immoral Object**

**Example:**  
A promises to pay B for prostitution.  
Courts see this as immoral → void.

---

### **6️⃣ Object Opposed to Public Policy**

This is wider — covers acts courts think would harm society.

Examples:

- **Trading with enemy:** A promises to supply goods to enemy country during war → void.
    
- **Marriage brokerage:** Paying someone to arrange a marriage for money → void.
    
- **Agreements restraining legal proceedings:** Contract not to file a case → void.
    

---

### **Relevant Case**

**Pearce v Brooks (1866)** — A coach owner hired out a coach to a prostitute knowing it would help her trade. The court refused to recover money — object was immoral.

---

### **Important Point**

💡 The **object and consideration** may be different. Both must be lawful.

- _If either is unlawful → whole agreement void._
    

**Example:**

- Consideration: Lawful payment.
    
- Object: Smuggling gold → unlawful → whole contract void.
    

---

### **Relevant Section**

**Section 23** applies to both consideration and object.  
**Section 24** says if any part is unlawful, the whole agreement is void.

---

### **Conclusion**

A valid contract needs **lawful object** and **lawful consideration**.  
An unlawful object makes the agreement **void** and **unenforceable**.

### ✅ **Possible Exam Question**

> _“Explain the legality of object under Section 23 with examples.”_

### 📌 **Tip**

✔ Use simple real-life examples: smuggling, bribery, crime, immoral contracts.  
✔ Always link object to **Section 23**.  
✔ Remember _object ≠ consideration_ — both must be lawful.

---

### ✏️ **Key Takeaways**

✔ **Object** = purpose of the agreement.  
✔ Must not be forbidden by law, defeat law, be fraudulent, cause injury, be immoral, or against public policy.  
✔ If the object is unlawful, the whole contract is void (**Sections 23 & 24**).  
✔ Always check if the purpose is lawful — not just the consideration.
