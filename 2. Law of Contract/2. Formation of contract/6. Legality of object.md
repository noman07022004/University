### üìå 2.6 Legality of object ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: The "object" of a contract is its purpose or design. This principle ensures that the ultimate goal of an agreement is lawful and not detrimental to society. It works in tandem with "lawful consideration" to form the broader requirement of legality. A contract might have lawful consideration (e.g., a simple payment of money), but if its core purpose is illegal, the contract is void.

While the previous topic focused on the lawfulness of the _things being exchanged_ (consideration), this topic focuses on the lawfulness of the _purpose_ for which the agreement is made. The legal principles that govern both are largely the same and are rooted in **Section 23 of the Contract Act, 1872**.

An agreement is void if its object is unlawful. An object is considered unlawful if it falls into one of the categories defined in Section 23.

#### üü° Agreements with an Unlawful Object

##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Object Forbidden by Law 
The purpose of the agreement is to do something that is expressly forbidden by a statute.

- **Example**: Two transport companies enter into an agreement to create a monopoly and fix cargo rates, in a jurisdiction where such anti-competitive agreements are prohibited by law. The _object_ of the agreement‚Äîto create a monopoly‚Äîis forbidden by law, so the agreement is void.
    

##### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Object Defeats the Provisions of Law 
The main purpose of the agreement is to circumvent a legal prohibition or undermine the intention of a law.

- **Example**: A person is declared insolvent, and their assets are supposed to be distributed among their creditors. They enter into an agreement with a friend to transfer a valuable painting to the friend to hide it from the official receiver. The _object_ of this agreement is to defeat the provisions of the insolvency laws.
    

##### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Fraudulent Object 
The purpose of the agreement is to commit fraud.

- **Example**: A and B enter into an agreement to sell imitation designer handbags as genuine articles to deceive customers. The entire _object_ of their business agreement is fraudulent, making it void.
    

##### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Object Involves Injury to Person or Property 
The agreement is aimed at causing harm to a third party.

- **Example**: A newspaper owner agrees with a journalist to publish a series of deliberately false articles to ruin the reputation of a business rival. The _object_ of the agreement is to cause injury (defamation) to another person.
    

##### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Object is Immoral or Opposed to Public Policy 
This is a broad and important category where the object itself is the central issue.

- **Immoral Object**: An agreement where a person rents a property to another with the full knowledge that the intended _purpose_ is to use it for running an illegal gambling operation.
    
- **Object Opposed to Public Policy**: This relates to agreements that are considered harmful to the welfare of the public. Key examples include:
    
    - **Trading with an Enemy**: An agreement made during wartime with a subject of an enemy country.
        
    - **Stifling Prosecution**: An agreement where one party provides a benefit to another in return for a promise not to pursue a criminal prosecution against them. The object is to interfere with the administration of justice.
        
    - **Marriage Brokerage Agreements**: An agreement to pay someone a sum of money to procure a spouse. The object of commercializing marriage is considered against public policy.
        

In short, the legality of the object is a test of the contract's ultimate goal. Even if the exchange (consideration) appears legal on the surface, if the underlying purpose of the deal is unlawful, the entire agreement is void and unenforceable.
