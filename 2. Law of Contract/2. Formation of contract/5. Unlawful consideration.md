### üìå 2.5 Unlawful consideration ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: This principle acts as a crucial gatekeeper, ensuring that the legal framework of contracts does not lend its power to enforce agreements that are illegal, immoral, or harmful to society. It establishes that the mere existence of a bargain (_quid pro quo_) is insufficient; the nature of that bargain must also be legally and ethically acceptable.

For an agreement to be a valid contract, it is essential that the consideration provided by the parties is lawful. The presence of unlawful consideration will render an entire agreement **void**, meaning it is a nullity from the very beginning and has no legal effect.

The law on this subject in Bangladesh is primarily contained in **Section 23 of the Contract Act, 1872**. This section provides a definitive list of situations where consideration (or the object of the agreement) is deemed unlawful.

#### üü° Categories of Unlawful Consideration under Section 23

According to Section 23, consideration is unlawful if:

##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ It is forbidden by law. 
This is the most direct category. It applies when the act that forms the consideration is expressly or implicitly prohibited by a statute.

- **Example**: An agreement to pay a sum of money to a person for them to sell you narcotics. The sale of narcotics is forbidden by laws like the Narcotics Control Act. Therefore, the consideration is unlawful, and the agreement is void.
    

##### 2Ô∏è‚É£ It would defeat the provisions of any law. 
This is a more subtle category. The consideration itself may not be explicitly forbidden, but its enforcement would undermine the purpose of another law.

- **Example**: A law provides that agricultural land cannot be sold to a non-farmer to protect farming communities. 'A', a non-farmer, agrees to pay 'B', a farmer, BDT 100,000 if B will purchase a piece of land in his own name but hold it for A's benefit. This agreement, if permitted, would defeat the object of the land law. The consideration is therefore unlawful.
    

##### 3Ô∏è‚É£ It is fraudulent. 
This applies where the consideration for a promise is an act of fraud or the purpose of the agreement is to defraud a third party.

- **Example**: A promises to pay B if B will deceive C, a potential buyer, about the quality of goods A is selling. The consideration (the act of deceit) is fraudulent and thus unlawful.
    

##### 4Ô∏è‚É£ It involves or implies injury to the person or property of another. 
This covers consideration that is tortious (a civil wrong) or criminal in nature.

- **Example**: A promises to pay B, a publisher, BDT 50,000 to publish a defamatory article about C. The consideration (publishing the libelous statement) involves injury to the reputation (person) of C and is unlawful.
    

##### 5Ô∏è‚É£ The Court regards it as immoral or opposed to public policy. 
This is a broad, flexible category that gives courts the discretion to invalidate agreements that are harmful to social values.

- **Immoral**: This is often related to sexual morality. For example, an agreement for future illicit cohabitation would be held void on the grounds of immoral consideration.
    
- **Opposed to Public Policy**: This covers acts that are injurious to the welfare of the state or the public. Examples include:
    
    - An agreement to stifle a criminal prosecution (e.g., paying a victim not to report a crime).
        
    - An agreement for the sale of public offices or titles.
        
    - An agreement that unreasonably restrains personal liberty or marriage.

#### üü° Effect of Partial Illegality: 
According to Section 24 of the Act, if any part of the consideration for an object is unlawful, the entire agreement is void. The law will not sever the "good" part from the "bad" part if they are inseparable.
