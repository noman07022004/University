## 📑 **2.5 Unlawful Consideration**

---

### **Introduction**

While **consideration** is essential for a valid contract, it must also be **lawful**.  
**Section 23** of the **Indian Contract Act, 1872** explains what makes the **object** or **consideration** unlawful.  
If the consideration or object is unlawful, the agreement is **void**.

---

### **Definition**

**Section 23** states:  
_"The consideration or object of an agreement is lawful unless it is forbidden by law; or is of such a nature that, if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of any law; or is fraudulent; or involves or implies injury to the person or property of another; or the court regards it as immoral or opposed to public policy."_

So, an agreement becomes void if its **consideration or object** is unlawful for any of these reasons.

### **When Consideration is Unlawful**

The **consideration** or **object** is unlawful if:

---

### ✅ **1️⃣ Forbidden by Law**

If an act is **prohibited by law**, any agreement to do it is void.

**Example:**  
A promises to pay B Tk. 5,000 to smuggle banned drugs — void, as smuggling is illegal.

---

### ✅ **2️⃣ Defeats the Provisions of Law**

If the consideration defeats the purpose of any law, it is unlawful.

**Example:**  
A agrees to pay B Tk. 10,000 to help him get a fake driving license — the purpose defeats the law.

---

### ✅ **3️⃣ Fraudulent**

If the object or consideration involves fraud, it is unlawful.

**Example:**  
A promises B Tk. 20,000 to help him fake income documents for a loan — fraudulent purpose.

---

### ✅ **4️⃣ Causes Injury to Person or Property**

If the agreement’s purpose is to cause harm to someone’s body or property, it is unlawful.

**Example:**  
A promises to pay B Tk. 1 lakh to burn C’s shop — injury to property, so void.

---

### ✅ **5️⃣ Immoral**

If the consideration is immoral by society’s standards, it is unlawful.

**Example:**  
A promises to pay B Tk. 50,000 for immoral cohabitation — immoral, so void.

---

### ✅ **6️⃣ Opposed to Public Policy**

If the agreement is harmful to society’s interests or goes against public welfare, courts will declare it void.

**Examples:**

- Marriage brokerage contracts: Paying someone to arrange a marriage for money.
    
- Agreements restraining parental rights.
    
- Trading with enemy during war.

If either is unlawful under **Section 23**, the contract is void and unenforceable.
