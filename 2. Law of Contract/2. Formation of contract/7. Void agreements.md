## 📑 **2.7 Void Agreements**

---

### **Introduction**

Not every agreement is a contract.  
An agreement must meet certain conditions to become enforceable by law.  
If an agreement **does not meet legal requirements**, it is called a **void agreement** — meaning it has **no legal effect** and cannot be enforced by any court.

---

### **Definition**

- According to **Section 2(g)** of the **Indian Contract Act, 1872**:  
    _“An agreement not enforceable by law is said to be void.”_
    

So, a **void agreement** has **no legal value** from the beginning or becomes void later.

---

### **Examples of Void Agreements**

Some agreements are declared **void** by the Act itself. Here are common examples:

---

### ✅ **1️⃣ Agreements Made by Incompetent Parties**

- If a minor or person of unsound mind makes an agreement, it is void.
    

**Example:**  
A minor signs a contract to buy a car → void.

---

### ✅ **2️⃣ Agreements Without Consideration**

- Under **Section 25**, an agreement without consideration is void unless it falls under specific exceptions (love and affection, past voluntary service, time-barred debt).
    

**Example:**  
A promises to gift B Tk. 5,000 without any reason → void.

---

### ✅ **3️⃣ Agreements with Unlawful Object or Consideration**

- If the object or consideration is unlawful under **Section 23**, the agreement is void.
    

**Example:**  
A agrees to smuggle gold for B → void.

---

### ✅ **4️⃣ Agreements in Restraint of Marriage (Section 26)**

- Any agreement restraining the marriage of any adult is void.
    

**Example:**  
A promises to pay B Tk. 50,000 if B does not marry for 5 years → void.

---

### ✅ **5️⃣ Agreements in Restraint of Trade (Section 27)**

- Any agreement that restrains a person from practicing a lawful trade or profession is void.
    

**Example:**  
A agrees never to open a shop in Bangladesh → void.

**Exception:** Reasonable restraints under **partnership law** and **sale of goodwill** are valid.

---

### ✅ **6️⃣ Agreements in Restraint of Legal Proceedings (Section 28)**

- Any agreement restricting a party’s right to approach the court is void.
    

**Example:**  
A agrees not to file a case against B for breach → void.

---

### ✅ **7️⃣ Wagering Agreements (Section 30)**

- Agreements based purely on chance, with no other interest — gambling or betting — are void.
    

**Example:**  
A and B bet Tk. 1,000 on a cricket match result → void.

---

### ✅ **8️⃣ Agreements with Uncertain Meaning (Section 29)**

- If the meaning of an agreement is uncertain or cannot be made certain, it is void.
    

**Example:**  
A agrees to sell B “a hundred tons of oil” without specifying the type → void for uncertainty.

---

### ✅ **9️⃣ Agreements Impossible to Perform (Section 56)**

- Agreements to do an impossible act are void.
    

**Example:**  
A agrees to bring back a dead person to life → impossible → void.

---

### **Difference: Void vs Voidable vs Illegal**

|Term|Meaning|Legal Effect|
|---|---|---|
|**Void**|Not enforceable by law|No legal effect|
|**Voidable**|Valid until avoided by one party|Enforceable until rescinded|
|**Illegal**|Forbidden by law|Void and punishable; collateral agreements also void|

---

### **Relevant Section**

**Sections 2(g)** and **Sections 23–30** deal with various void agreements.

---

### **Conclusion**

A void agreement is **dead from the start** or becomes void later due to some legal defect.  
Understanding which agreements are void helps avoid **invalid contracts** that waste time and money.
