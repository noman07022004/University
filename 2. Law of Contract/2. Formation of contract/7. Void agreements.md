### üìå 2.7 Void agreements ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: This topic identifies specific types of agreements that are considered a complete nullity by the law. These are not just flawed or defective contracts; they are dead from the outset. Knowing these statutory prohibitions is essential, as they act as absolute bars to the enforcement of an agreement, regardless of the parties' intentions.

A **void agreement** is defined in Section 2(g) of the **Contract Act, 1872**, as "an agreement not enforceable by law." It is a legal nullity from the moment of its creation, a concept known as **_void ab initio_**. No legal rights or obligations can arise from a void agreement. It is as if no agreement was ever made.

This is fundamentally different from a **voidable contract**, which is a valid contract that can be cancelled by one of the parties (e.g., due to coercion or fraud).

The Contract Act, 1872, expressly declares several categories of agreements to be void.

#### üü° Statutorily Void Agreements
##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Agreement under a Bilateral Mistake of Fact (Section 20) 
Where both parties to an agreement are under a mistake as to a matter of fact that is essential to the agreement, the agreement is void.

- **Example**: A agrees to buy a specific painting from B. Unknown to both, the painting was destroyed in a fire the previous night. The agreement is void because the subject matter did not exist.
    

##### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Agreement with Unlawful Consideration or Object (Section 23) 
As discussed previously, any agreement whose purpose or consideration is illegal, fraudulent, immoral, or against public policy is void.

##### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Agreement without Consideration (Section 25) 
The general rule is that an agreement made without consideration is void. However, this section provides key exceptions, such as a written and registered promise made out of natural love and affection.

##### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Agreement in Restraint of Marriage (Section 26) 
Every agreement that restrains the marriage of any person, other than a minor, is void. The law considers the freedom to marry a matter of public interest.

- **Example**: A promises to pay B BDT 100,000 if B never marries. This agreement is void.
    

##### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Agreement in Restraint of Trade (Section 27) 
This is a significant category. Any agreement that restrains a person from exercising a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind is, to that extent, void.

- **Rationale**: This principle encourages free competition and protects an individual's right to earn a livelihood.
    
- **Exception**: The main exception is the **sale of goodwill**. The seller of a business can agree with the buyer not to carry on a similar business within specified local limits, provided those limits are reasonable. This protects the buyer's investment.
    

##### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Agreement in Restraint of Legal Proceedings (Section 28) 
An agreement that completely prevents a party from enforcing their rights in court or that reduces the standard legal time limit for bringing a lawsuit is void. Access to justice is a fundamental right that cannot be contracted away.

- **Exception**: An agreement to refer disputes to **arbitration** is valid and enforceable.
    

##### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Agreements with Uncertain Meaning (Section 29) 
Agreements whose terms are not certain, or are not capable of being made certain, are void. The court cannot enforce a contract if it cannot determine what the parties agreed to.

- **Example**: A agrees to sell his house to B for "either BDT 20 lakh or BDT 25 lakh." The agreement is void for uncertainty.
    

##### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Wagering Agreements (Section 30) 
A wagering agreement is a bet‚Äîan agreement to pay money or money's worth based on the outcome of a future, uncertain event. All such agreements are void.

- **Example**: A and B bet on the outcome of a cricket match. This is a wagering agreement and is legally unenforceable. Neither party can sue the other for the amount won.
