>**Why Important**: This topic is the heart of the entire subject. It dissects the precise legal mechanics of how a legally binding agreement comes into existence. Every element discussed here is a potential point of failure in a contractual dispute and forms the basis for the majority of examination questions. Mastering the rules of offer, acceptance, and consideration is absolutely non-negotiable for understanding contract law.

The formation of a contract is the process by which a mere agreement transforms into a legally enforceable set of promises. It is not a casual event but a sequence that must satisfy specific legal criteria. This process can be broken down into three fundamental stages: first, the parties must reach a complete **agreement**; second, this agreement must be supported by **consideration**; and third, it must satisfy other essential requirements like **legality** and **genuine consent**.

### 🟡 The Agreement: Offer and Acceptance

The first pillar of any contract is a mutual agreement, which the law identifies through the mechanics of offer and acceptance. This is the stage of _consensus ad idem_ (a meeting of the minds).

An **Offer** (defined as a 'proposal' in Section 2(a) of the Contract Act, 1872) is a clear and unambiguous statement of the terms on which the offeror is willing to be bound, made with the intention that it will become a binding agreement upon acceptance. A crucial distinction must be made between a genuine offer and an **invitation to treat (ITT)**. An ITT is merely an expression of willingness to enter into negotiations. Classic examples of ITTs include:

- Goods displayed in a shop window or on a supermarket shelf (_Pharmaceutical Society of GB v Boots Cash Chemists_). The customer makes the offer at the checkout counter.
    
- Advertisements, circulars, and price lists (_Partridge v Crittenden_). These are invitations to the public to make offers.
    

However, an advertisement can be a **unilateral offer** if it contains a clear promise in return for an act, as famously established in _Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co._, where the company's promise to pay £100 to anyone who used their product and still caught influenza was held to be a valid offer to the world at large.

**Acceptance**, as per Section 2(b) of the Act, is the final and unqualified expression of assent to the terms of an offer. For acceptance to be valid, it must be the **"mirror image"** of the offer. If the offeree attempts to change the terms, it is not an acceptance but a **counter-offer**, which has the legal effect of destroying the original offer. Acceptance must also be communicated to the offeror. As a general rule, silence cannot constitute acceptance.

An offer does not remain open indefinitely. The **termination of an offer** can occur in several ways (Section 6 of the Act), including **revocation** by the offeror before acceptance, **lapse** after a specified or reasonable time, rejection by the offeree, or the death of either party.

### 🟡 The Bargain: Consideration and Legality

An agreement alone is not enough; it must be part of a bargain. This is the requirement of **consideration**, defined in Section 2(d) as something done or promised at the desire of the promisor. It is the _quid pro quo_ ("something for something") that makes a promise legally enforceable. The key rules are that consideration must be real (not illusory) but need not be adequate (the courts will not question the fairness of the price).

Critically, the consideration and the **object** (purpose) of the contract must be lawful. **Unlawful consideration** or a contract with an **illegality of object** is void from the start (Section 23). For example, an agreement to pay someone to commit a crime is void because both the consideration (the criminal act) and the object are illegal.

This leads to the concept of **void agreements** (Section 2(g)), which are agreements not enforceable by law. The Contract Act, 1872, expressly declares certain types of agreements to be void, such as those in restraint of marriage (Sec 26), trade (Sec 27), legal proceedings (Sec 28), and wagering agreements (bets) (Sec 30).

### 🟡 Genuineness of the Agreement: Free Consent

A core requirement for a valid contract is that the parties' consent must be genuine. Section 14 of the Act states that consent is not **free** if it is caused by vitiating factors such as coercion, undue influence, fraud, or misrepresentation. The presence of any of these factors generally makes the contract **voidable** at the option of the innocent party, meaning they can choose to either cancel the contract or affirm it.

### 🟡 Conditional Agreements: Contingent Contracts

Not all contractual obligations are absolute. A **contingent contract** (Section 31) is a contract where the performance of the promise depends on the happening or non-happening of a future uncertain event that is collateral to the contract. A contract of insurance is the classic example: the insurer's duty to pay is contingent upon a fire occurring. This is distinct from a **wagering agreement** (a bet). The key difference is that in a contingent contract, the parties have a legitimate interest in the subject matter outside of the event itself (e.g., the policyholder owns the insured property), whereas in a wager, the parties' only interest is the monetary stake they stand to win or lose from the outcome of the uncertain event.

In essence, the formation of a contract is a systematic process where an offer is accepted to form an agreement, which is then solidified by lawful consideration and purpose, and validated by the free consent of the parties.
