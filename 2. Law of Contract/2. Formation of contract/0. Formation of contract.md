## 📑 **Formation of Contract** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> Why important: This is the foundation. If you understand how a contract _comes into being_ — what each piece does and why it matters — everything else (performance, breach, remedies) becomes logical instead of a pile of rules to memorize.

---

### 💡 Big picture (one-line)

A contract is a bargain that becomes legally binding when: someone makes a real offer, someone else accepts it clearly, something of value is exchanged, and the agreement is made between capable people, freely, for a lawful and clear purpose.

---

## The building blocks — explained simply

### 1) Offer (what it is)

- A clear proposal: “I will do X if you do Y.”
    
- Must show real willingness to be bound if accepted.
    
- Example: “I’ll sell you my bike for 30,000 taka” = offer.
    
- Not an offer: “I might sell my bike someday” (that’s talk/negotiation).
    

### 2) Acceptance (what it is)

- A clear “yes” to the offer as it stands — no changes.
    
- Must be communicated (you can’t accept secretly).
    
- If you change terms, that’s a **counter-offer**, not acceptance.
    
- Example: Buyer says “I accept your 30,000” → contract formed.
    

### 3) Consideration (why it matters)

- The “price” each side pays for the promise (money, service, forbearance).
    
- It creates mutual obligation — both sides give something.
    
- Not always money — could be a promise to work, to pay later, to deliver goods.
    
- Simple rule to remember: **if nothing is exchanged, usually no contract** (exceptions exist, but don’t worry about those now).
    

### 4) Capacity (who can contract)

- Parties must be able to make binding promises (not children/minors, not mentally incapable).
    
- If a person lacks capacity, the agreement won’t bind them in the usual way.
    

### 5) Free consent (how the decision must be made)

- Consent must be honest and voluntary — not by threat, pressure, lying, or major misunderstanding.
    
- If consent was bought by force, fraud, undue influence, or significant mistake, the contract is weak or voidable.
    

### 6) Lawful object & certainty (what the contract must be about)

- The purpose must be legal and sensible.
    
- Terms must be clear enough to know what each party promised (who, what, how much, when).
    
- Vague promises (e.g., “sell me some goods sometime”) are not enforceable.

## Other practical points (short)

### Termination of an offer (when you _cannot_ accept it anymore)

- The person who makes the offer can withdraw it before it’s accepted.
    
- Offer ends if the offeree rejects it, makes a counter-offer, or after a reasonable time.
    
- If the offeror dies or the subject matter is destroyed before acceptance, the offer ends.
    

### Contingent contract vs. Wager

- **Contingent contract**: performance depends on a real future event (insurance is a classic example).
    
- **Wager**: pure bet on an uncertain event with no real interest — courts treat wagers as void/unenforceable.

## How to _think_ about formation (exam & practical mindset)

1. Start with the flow: **Offer → Acceptance → Consideration**.
    
2. Then check: **Who** are the parties? Did they give **free consent**? Is the **purpose lawful and clear**?
    
3. If anything fails, ask whether the agreement is **void** (no legal effect) or **voidable** (one party can cancel it).

## Short examples to fix ideas

- Simple valid contract: “Sell me 100 kg rice at 30 taka/kg, delivery 1 June, I pay on delivery.” → clear offer, clear acceptance, price = consideration, definite time/place.
    
- Not a contract: “I’ll love you forever and I’ll give you money” → emotions aren’t enforceable obligations; too vague and personal.
    
- Possibly problematic but real: “I’ll pay your education; you’ll pay me 50% of income for 10 years after 30.” → might be valid if entered into freely by adults with clear, fair terms — but courts may refuse unconscionable bargains.

## Common student mistakes (so you don’t make them)

- Treating **invitation to negotiate** (ads, catalogues) as offers. It isn’t.
    
- Confusing **acceptance** with mere silence. Silence ≠ acceptance.
    
- Thinking **consideration has to be adequate**. It doesn’t — it must simply exist.
    
- Forgetting consent can be **vitiated** (ruined) by force/fraud — then it’s not a fair contract.

## How to answer exam questions (without rote learning)

- Explain the **idea** briefly (e.g., “Offer is…”) → give **one short example** → explain why it matters (practical effect).
    
- Use the flowchart in your head: Offer → Acceptance → Consideration → Capacity & Consent → Lawful object & Certainty.
    
- If asked to criticize or apply: always connect back to **how formation affects enforceability**.
