## 📑 **2.3 Termination of Offer**

---

### **Introduction**

Not every offer stays open forever.  
An offer may come to an end due to various reasons, either **naturally** or by the action of the offeror or offeree.  
Knowing **when and how an offer terminates** is important — because once an offer is terminated, it **cannot be accepted**.

---

### **Legal Basis**

**Sections 6, 7, and 8** of the **Indian Contract Act, 1872** deal with termination of offers.

---

### **Modes of Termination of Offer**

---

### ✅ **1️⃣ Revocation by Offeror (Section 5)**

- The offeror may withdraw (revoke) the offer at any time **before it is accepted**.
    
- Once acceptance is complete _against the proposer_ (when it is posted), revocation is not possible.
    

**Example:**  
A offers to sell goods to B. A revokes the offer before B posts a letter of acceptance — the revocation is valid.

---

### ✅ **2️⃣ Lapse of Time (Section 6(2))**

- If the offer states a time for acceptance, it automatically lapses after that time.
    
- If no time is specified, it lapses after a **reasonable time**.
    

**Example:**  
A offers to sell his bike valid for 10 days. If B does not accept within 10 days, the offer ends.

---

### ✅ **3️⃣ Failure to Fulfil Condition Precedent (Section 6(3))**

- If the offer is subject to a condition and the offeree fails to fulfil it, the offer lapses.
    

**Example:**  
A offers to sell his house to B if B pays an advance within 5 days. If B fails to pay, the offer ends.

---

### ✅ **4️⃣ Death or Insanity of Offeror (Section 6(4))**

- An offer lapses if the offeror dies or becomes insane **before acceptance** and the offeree knows of it.
    
- If the offeree accepts without knowing, it may still bind the offeror’s estate.
    

**Example:**  
A offers to sell land to B, but A dies before B accepts — B learns of A’s death, so the offer lapses.

---

### ✅ **5️⃣ Rejection by Offeree (Section 6(1))**

- If the offeree rejects the offer, it ends immediately.
    

**Example:**  
A offers to sell a bike. B rejects it. Later, B cannot accept — the offer is gone.

---

### ✅ **6️⃣ Counter-Offer (Section 7)**

- A counter-offer amounts to rejection of the original offer and puts a new offer in its place.
    
- The original offer cannot be revived unless the offeror agrees.
    

**Example:**  
A offers to sell a laptop for Tk. 40,000. B says, _“I will buy it for Tk. 35,000.”_ — This is a counter-offer. If A does not agree, the original offer is gone.

---

### ✅ **7️⃣ Non-Acceptance According to Prescribed or Usual Mode (Section 7(2))**

- If the offeror prescribes a specific mode of acceptance and the offeree does not follow it, the offer may lapse if the offeror informs the offeree within a reasonable time.
    

**Example:**  
A requires acceptance by email. B sends acceptance by post. If A informs B that the mode was wrong, the offer is not accepted.

---

### ✅ **8️⃣ By Law (Section 8)**

- Sometimes an offer is terminated by the law.
    
- For example, the performance of the offer becomes impossible due to a change in law or supervening impossibility.
    

**Example:**  
A offers to supply goods from abroad. Before acceptance, the government bans imports. The offer lapses.

---

### **Conclusion**

Termination of offer ensures that parties know clearly **when an offer is still open** and when it is no longer possible to accept.  
Once an offer terminates, any attempted acceptance is invalid.

✔ Give small, clear examples for each mode.  
✔ Remember the link: _Termination means no acceptance is possible after._

### ✏️ **Key Takeaways**

✔ Offers may end by revocation, lapse of time, rejection, counter-offer, failure of conditions, death or insanity, non-fulfilment of prescribed mode, or by operation of law.  
✔ Once an offer is terminated, it cannot be accepted.  
✔ Sections **5**, **6**, **7**, and **8** explain how offers end.  
✔ Know the difference: _Revocation_ = withdrawn by offeror, _Rejection_ = refused by offeree.
