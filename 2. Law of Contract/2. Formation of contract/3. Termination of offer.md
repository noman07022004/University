## üìå 2.3 Termination of offer ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: An offer is not immortal; it has a finite lifespan. Understanding the specific events that can extinguish an offer is just as critical as knowing how one is made. It is impossible to determine if a valid acceptance has occurred without first confirming that the offer was still "alive" at the moment of acceptance. This is a crucial component of problem-solving in contract formation.

Once an offer has been terminated, it is dead and cannot be accepted. Any attempt to accept a terminated offer is legally ineffective and will not result in a contract. The **Contract Act, 1872**, primarily in Section 6, outlines the various ways an offer (a proposal) can be terminated.

### üü° Modes of Termination

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Revocation by the Offeror 
The offeror is the master of their offer and can withdraw it at any time **before** it has been accepted. This is known as revocation.

- **Communication is Key**: For a revocation to be effective, it must be **communicated** to the offeree. According to Section 5 of the Act, the revocation is not complete until it comes to the knowledge of the offeree.
    
- **Case Law**: The classic case is **_Byrne & Co v Van Tienhoven (1880)_**.
    
    - **Facts**: An offer was posted from Cardiff to New York on Oct 1. A revocation was posted on Oct 8. The offer arrived on Oct 11 and was immediately accepted by telegram. The letter of revocation did not arrive until Oct 20.
        
    - **Held**: A binding contract was formed on Oct 11. The revocation was ineffective until it was received on Oct 20, by which time the offer had already been accepted. This case firmly establishes that the postal rule does **not** apply to revocations.
        
- **Communication via a Third Party**: Revocation does not have to be communicated by the offeror directly. It is effective if the offeree learns of the withdrawal from a reliable third-party source (_Dickinson v Dodds (1876)_).
    

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Rejection by the Offeree 
An offer is terminated as soon as the offeree rejects it.

- **Express Rejection**: This occurs when the offeree explicitly states they are not interested (e.g., saying "No").
    
- **Counter-Offer as Rejection**: As discussed previously, a counter-offer, which attempts to change the terms of the original offer, automatically acts as a rejection. The case of **_Hyde v Wrench (1840)_** is the key authority here.
    

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Lapse of Time 
An offer will terminate automatically if it is not accepted within the specified time.

- If no time is specified in the offer, it will lapse after a **reasonable time**.
    
- What constitutes a "reasonable time" is a question of fact depending on the circumstances, particularly the subject matter of the contract. An offer to sell stocks and shares will have a very short lifespan, whereas an offer to sell a piece of land will remain open for longer.
    

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Failure to Fulfil a Condition Precedent 
An offer may be made subject to a certain condition. If that condition is not met, the offer is automatically terminated. For instance, an offer to hire an employee might be conditional on the applicant passing a medical examination. If they fail the exam, the offer terminates.

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Death or Insanity of the Parties

- **Death/Insanity of the Offeror**: According to Section 6, an offer is terminated if the offeree learns of the offeror's death or insanity **before** accepting. If the offeree accepts without knowledge of the death or insanity, a contract may still be formed, provided the contract is not one that requires the personal services of the deceased offeror.
    
- **Death of the Offeree**: If the offeree dies, the offer, being personal to them, generally cannot be accepted by their estate.

**Important Note on Unilateral Offers**: Revoking a unilateral offer (e.g., an offer of a reward for an act) presents a unique problem. Can the offeror revoke the offer once the offeree has started to perform the act? The general legal position is that once performance has begun, the offeror cannot revoke the offer. The offer is seen as implicitly containing a second promise not to revoke it once the offeree embarks on performance.
