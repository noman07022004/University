## 📑 **2.9 Contingent Contracts**

---

### **Introduction**

Not every contract takes effect immediately.  
Some contracts depend on the **happening or non-happening** of an uncertain future event — these are called **contingent contracts**.  
They are used often in **insurance**, **indemnity**, **guarantees**, and similar fields.

---

### **Definition**

**Section 31** of the **Indian Contract Act, 1872** defines a contingent contract as:  
_"A contingent contract is a contract to do or not do something, if some event, collateral to such contract, does or does not happen."_

**Key point:** The performance of the contract **depends on a condition** that may or may not happen.

---

### ✅ **Key Elements of a Contingent Contract**

---

### **1️⃣ Depends on Happening or Non-Happening of a Future Event**

- The event must be **uncertain**.
    
- If the event is certain, it is not contingent.
    

**Example:**  
A contracts to pay B Tk. 10,000 if B’s ship returns safely from a voyage.  
The contract depends on an uncertain event → contingent contract.

---

### **2️⃣ Event Must be Collateral**

- The event should not form part of the performance itself, but be **collateral** (independent condition).
    

**Example:**  
A agrees to sell goods to B if C delivers raw materials to A.  
C’s delivery is collateral to A and B’s contract.

---

### ✅ **3️⃣ Event Must Not be Mere Will of Promisor**

- The event must be outside the promisor’s control.
    

**Example:**  
A promises to pay B if he wishes to do so — not contingent → no binding contract.

---

### **Examples**

✔ **Insurance:** An insurance company agrees to pay compensation if a house catches fire.  
✔ **Guarantee:** A agrees to pay B if C fails to pay his debt.  
✔ **Contracts depending on court decisions:** A agrees to buy land if B wins a lawsuit for its ownership.

### **Rules Regarding Enforcement — Sections 32–36**

---

### ✅ **Section 32: Enforcement When Event Happens**

- If a contract depends on a happening, it can be enforced only if the event happens.
    

**Example:**  
A agrees to pay B Tk. 50,000 if C passes an exam. C passes → contract enforceable.

---

### ✅ **Section 33: Enforcement When Event Does Not Happen**

- If a contract depends on a non-happening, it can be enforced when it becomes certain that the event will not happen.
    

**Example:**  
A agrees to pay B if a ship does _not_ return. If the ship sinks → event will not happen → contract enforceable.

---

### ✅ **Section 34: Future Conduct of Living Person**

- If the event is the conduct of a person, it becomes impossible when it’s certain the person will not act as required.
    

**Example:**  
A agrees to pay B if C marries D. If D marries someone else, event becomes impossible.

---

### ✅ **Section 35: Impossible Events**

- If the event becomes impossible, the contract becomes void.
    

**Example:**  
A promises to pay B Tk. 10,000 if B’s dead father returns alive — impossible → void.

---

### ✅ **Section 36: Agreements Contingent on Impossible Events**

- If the event is known to be impossible at the time of making the contract, it is void.
    

**Example:**  
A agrees to pay B if the sun rises in the west → void from the beginning.

### **Difference: Absolute vs. Contingent Contracts**

|Aspect|Absolute Contract|Contingent Contract|
|---|---|---|
|Event|No condition; performance is certain|Performance depends on uncertain future event|
|Enforceability|Immediately enforceable|Enforceable only when event happens/doesn’t happen|
|Example|A sells goods to B today|A promises to sell goods if ship arrives|

---

### **Relevant Case**

**N.P.O. Ramaya v K.S.P. Kalyani (1939)** — Explained that a contingent contract must depend on a collateral condition.

---

### **Conclusion**

Contingent contracts provide **flexibility** and **security** for uncertain future situations.  
They protect parties by making performance conditional on events outside their control.

---

### ✅ **Possible Exam Question**

> _“What is a contingent contract? How does it differ from an ordinary contract? Explain with examples.”_

---

### 📌 **Tip**

✔ Quote **Section 31** for definition.  
✔ Link to **Sections 32–36** for enforcement rules.  
✔ Always use simple examples: insurance, guarantees, lost ship, etc.

---

### ✏️ **Key Takeaways**

✔ Contingent contract = depends on an uncertain event (**Section 31**).  
✔ Event must be collateral and not the mere will of promisor.  
✔ Rules for performance: Sections **32–36**.  
✔ If the event becomes impossible → contract void.  
✔ Common in insurance and guarantees.
