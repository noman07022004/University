### üìå 2.9 Contingent contracts ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: This topic explains a common and commercially significant type of contract where performance is conditional upon a future event. Understanding how these "if/then" contracts work is vital for grasping the mechanics of insurance, indemnity, and guarantee agreements, all of which are foundational to commercial law.

A contingent contract is essentially a conditional contract. Its performance depends on the happening or non-happening of a future, uncertain event. The **Contract Act, 1872**, defines it in **Section 31**:

> _"A 'contingent contract' is a contract to do or not to do something, if some event, collateral to such contract, does or does not happen."_

The most common and easily understood example is a **contract of insurance**. An insurance company promises to pay the insured a sum of money _if_ their house is damaged by fire. The obligation to pay is contingent upon the fire. üî•

#### üü° Essential Characteristics

##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Depends on a Contingency: 
The core obligations of the contract are not absolute; they are dependent on the outcome of a future event.
    
##### 2Ô∏è‚É£ The Event Must Be Uncertain: 
The event must be one that may or may not happen. If the event is certain to occur, it is not a contingency, and the contract is not a contingent one.
    
##### 3Ô∏è‚É£ The Event Must Be Collateral to the Contract: 
This is a crucial element. The uncertain event must be incidental to the main purpose of the contract, not the main purpose itself. It is the trigger for the performance, not the performance itself.
    
- **Example of a Collateral Event (Contingent Contract)**: A agrees to pay B BDT 50,000 if B's shipment is lost at sea. The main contract is the payment of money. The loss of the shipment is the uncertain, collateral event that triggers the payment.
	
- **Example of a Non-Collateral Event (Not a Contingent Contract)**: A promises to pay B BDT 50,000 if B delivers a cargo of goods. Here, the delivery of goods is the very consideration for the promise to pay. It is a reciprocal promise, not a collateral event.
        

#### üü° Rules Regarding Enforcement

The Contract Act (Sections 32-36) lays down specific rules for when these contracts can be enforced:

- **Contingent on an Event Happening (Sec 32)**: The contract can only be enforced when the event happens. If the event becomes impossible, the contract becomes void. (e.g., A contract to pay a sum if ship 'X' arrives. If the ship sinks, the contract is void).
    
- **Contingent on an Event _Not_ Happening (Sec 33)**: The contract can be enforced when the happening of that event becomes impossible. (e.g., A contract to pay a sum if ship 'X' does _not_ return. If the ship sinks, the contract can be enforced).
    
- **Contingent on an Event Happening Within a Fixed Time (Sec 35)**: The contract becomes void if the event does not happen within the specified time, or if it becomes impossible before the time expires.
    

In summary, a contingent contract is an agreement where the primary obligations are dormant until a specified, uncertain, and collateral event awakens them.
