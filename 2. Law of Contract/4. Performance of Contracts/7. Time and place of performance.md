## 📑 **4.7 Performance of Contracts: Time and Place of Performance**

---

### ✅ **Introduction**

Every contract must be performed:

- **At the right time**, and
    
- **At the right place**.
    

➡️ The rules about time and place help decide **when** and **where** the parties must fulfil their promises.

These are covered mainly under **Sections 46–50** of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.

---

### ✅ **Key Provisions**

---

**🔹 Section 46 — Time for Performance (No Time Fixed)**  
If no time is fixed → the promisor must perform within a **reasonable time**.

✔ Example:  
A agrees to deliver rice to B but no date is fixed. A must deliver it within a reasonable period.

---

**🔹 Section 47 — Time for Performance (Time Fixed, No Application Needed)**  
If a time is fixed but no application by promisee is needed → the promisor must perform on that day **during usual business hours**.

✔ Example:  
A must deliver goods to B on 1st August. A must deliver them on that day, during working hours.

---

**🔹 Section 48 — Time for Performance (On Application by Promisee)**  
If the promisee must demand performance → the promisor must perform at a **reasonable place and time** specified by the promisee.

✔ Example:  
A agrees to repair B’s house “when B asks.” B must fix a time and place for A.

---

**🔹 Section 49 — Place for Performance**  
If no place is agreed → the promisor must ask the promisee to fix a reasonable place.

✔ Example:  
A agrees to deliver machinery but the contract does not fix a place. A must request B to fix a place.

---

**🔹 Section 50 — Performance in Manner or at Time Prescribed by Promisee**  
If the promisee prescribes the **manner or time**, the promisor must follow it.

✔ Example:  
A owes B Tk. 10,000. B says, “Pay me only at my office between 10 am–1 pm.” A must follow this instruction.

### ✅ **Time as the Essence of Contract**

➡️ Sometimes, **time is crucial** for performance.

✔ If **time is of the essence**, failure to perform on time = breach.

✔ If time is **not essential**, delay gives only right to claim compensation.

**Example:**  
Perishable goods or urgent delivery → time is essential.

### ✅ **Relevant Case**

**Sardar Singh v Krishna Devi (1994)**  
Held: If time is the essence and one party delays → the other party can rescind the contract.
