### üìå 4.7 Time and place of performance ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: The "when" and "where" of a contract are fundamental terms. Disputes over delays and incorrect delivery locations are common. These rules, primarily found in **Sections 46-50 of the Contract Act, 1872**, provide a clear, logical framework for determining the proper time and place for performance, which is essential for the smooth execution of contracts.

The performance of a promise must be completed at the time and place agreed upon by the parties. If the contract is silent on these details, the law provides a set of default rules.

#### üü° Rules Regarding Time of Performance

##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Where Time is Specified 
If the contract itself stipulates a day for performance, the promisor must perform their obligation on that specific day. The performance should be offered during the usual hours of business.

##### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Where No Time is Specified (Section 46) 
If the contract does not specify a time for performance, the promise must be performed within a **reasonable time**.

- **What is "reasonable time"?** This is a question of fact that depends on the context of the contract. For example, a reasonable time for delivering fresh vegetables would be very short, while a reasonable time for delivering custom-made furniture would be much longer. ‚è∞

#### üü° Rules Regarding Place of Performance

##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Where Place is Specified 
If the contract specifies a place of performance, the obligation must be performed there.

##### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Where No Place is Specified (and promisor must perform without request) (Section 49) 
This is a key rule. When a promise is to be performed without a request from the promisee, and no place is fixed, it is the **duty of the promisor to ask the promisee** to fix a reasonable place for the performance.

- **Rationale**: This rule prevents the promisor from being in an uncertain position. It places the burden on the party who has to act (the promisor) to seek clarity from the party who will receive the performance (the promisee).
    
- **Example**: A contracts to deliver 100 bags of cement to B on a fixed day. A must apply to B to appoint a reasonable place for the delivery. üöö
    

##### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Performance in a Manner Prescribed by the Promisee (Section 50) 
The promisee can dictate or approve the time and manner of performance. If the promisor performs in the way the promisee prescribes, the performance is valid.

- **Example**: B owes A BDT 2,000. A asks B to pay the money to A's agent, C. B pays the money to C. The debt is now discharged, as the performance was done in the manner prescribed by the promisee.
