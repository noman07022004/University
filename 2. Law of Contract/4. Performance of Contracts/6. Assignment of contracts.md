## 📑 **4.6 Performance of Contracts: Assignment of Contracts**

---

### ✅ **Introduction**

**Assignment** means **transferring rights or obligations** under a contract to another person.

➡️ It allows a party to pass their **benefits or duties** to someone else — with conditions.

Assignment is useful when:

- A party wants to transfer their **benefits** (e.g., right to receive money).
    
- Or wants someone else to perform **duties** (which is limited).

### ✅ **Legal Basis**

The Indian Contract Act **doesn’t have a separate chapter** on assignment but it is derived from:

- General contract principles.
    
- Property law (Transfer of Property Act, 1882).

### 🔹 **Types of Assignment**

---

**1️⃣ Assignment of Rights (Actionable Claims)**  
➡️ Allowed **freely** unless the contract says otherwise.  
✔ Example:  
A lends Tk. 50,000 to B. A can transfer the right to recover the money to C.

---

**2️⃣ Assignment of Liabilities (Obligations)**  
➡️ Generally **cannot** be transferred **without consent** of the other party.

✔ Example:  
A contracts to paint B’s house. A **cannot** ask C to do it unless B agrees.

---

### ✅ **How Assignment Happens**

---

**A. By Act of Parties**  
1️⃣ _Voluntary_ — e.g., selling a debt, giving it as gift.  
2️⃣ _With consent_ — for transferring obligations.

---

**B. By Operation of Law**  
Happens automatically:  
✔ On death → rights & obligations pass to legal heirs (except personal ones).  
✔ On insolvency → rights & liabilities pass to an official receiver.

---

### ✅ **When Assignment is Not Allowed**

✔ When the contract is **personal in nature** (personal skill or trust).  
✔ When the contract **expressly prohibits assignment**.

---

### ✅ **Difference Between Assignment & Novation**

**Assignment**  
➡️ Only _rights_ can be assigned freely.  
➡️ _Obligations_ need consent.

**Novation (Sec. 62)**  
➡️ Entire contract is replaced by a new one → both rights & duties change.

---

**Example Difference:**  
✔ Assignment: A assigns B’s debt to C → same contract continues.  
✔ Novation: A, B, and C agree that C will repay B instead of A → old contract ends.

---

### ✅ **Relevant Case**

**Khedarlal v Bhagirath (1956)**  
Court held: Contractual rights can be assigned, but personal obligations cannot be transferred without consent.

### ✅ **Possible Exam Question**

> _“Discuss assignment of contracts and explain when it is valid.”_

---

### 📌 **Tip**

✔ Distinguish between _rights_ and _duties_.  
✔ Use clear examples — debt assignment is easiest.  
✔ Link to **novation** for contrast.

---

### ✏️ **Key Takeaways**

✔ Rights under a contract can usually be assigned.  
✔ Obligations need consent of the other party.  
✔ Personal skill contracts can’t be assigned.  
✔ On death or insolvency, rights/duties pass automatically.
