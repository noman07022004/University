### 📌 4.6 Assignment of contracts ⭐⭐

>**Why Not as Critical**: While the assignment of contracts is a vital mechanism in commercial and financial law (e.g., selling debts), the detailed rules are often secondary in a foundational contract law course. The core takeaway is the fundamental difference between transferring rights and transferring obligations, which is a key concept but less frequently tested in-depth than the primary rules of performance.

Assignment of a contract refers to the process of transferring contractual rights or liabilities to a third party who was not an original party to the agreement. The law makes a critical distinction between the assignment of rights (benefits) and the assignment of liabilities (burdens).

#### 🟡 Assignment of Contractual Rights (Benefits)

The general rule is that the rights or benefits under a contract can be freely assigned by the promisee (the **assignor**) to a third party (the **assignee**). The consent of the promisor (the debtor) is not required.

- **What can be assigned?**: The right to receive a benefit, most commonly the right to receive payment of a debt.
    
- **Rationale**: Contractual rights are treated as a form of intangible property (_chose in action_) that can be bought and sold.
    
- **Example**: B owes A BDT 50,000. A needs money urgently, so he transfers his right to receive this payment to C for BDT 45,000. A has **assigned** the right to C. Now, C has the legal right to collect the BDT 50,000 from B. B must pay C, not A.
    
- **Notice**: For the assignment to be legally binding on the debtor (B), the assignee (C) must give notice of the assignment to them.
    

**Limitation**: Rights under a contract of a **personal nature** cannot be assigned. For example, if a famous singer is hired to perform at a wedding, the host cannot assign the right to the singer's performance to someone else for their party.

#### 🟡 Assignment of Contractual Liabilities (Burdens)

The rule for liabilities is the complete opposite. A party **cannot** assign their obligations under a contract to a third party without the **consent of the promisee**.

- **Rationale**: A person enters into a contract based on the specific skill, creditworthiness, and reliability of the party they are dealing with. They cannot be forced to accept performance from a stranger who may not be as competent or trustworthy.
    
- **Example**: A, a highly-regarded software company, contracts to develop an app for B. A cannot simply transfer its obligation to build the app to C, a new startup company, without B's explicit agreement.
    

**How can liabilities be transferred?** The only way to transfer a liability is through **novation**. This involves creating a new contract with the consent of **all three parties**, where the original promisor is released and the new party takes on the obligation. The old contract is discharged.

In short, the rule is simple: **you can give away your benefits, but you cannot give away your burdens** without permission.
