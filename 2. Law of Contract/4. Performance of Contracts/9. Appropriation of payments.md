## 📑 **4.9 Performance of Contracts: Appropriation of Payments**

---

### ✅ **Introduction**

When a debtor owes **more than one debt** to the same creditor and makes a payment **without clearing all debts**, the payment must be **appropriated** (adjusted) to a specific debt.

➡️ **Who decides?**

- The **debtor** can choose which debt to clear.
    
- If the debtor does not specify → the **creditor** can choose.
    
- If neither appropriates → the law decides.
    

These rules are in **Sections 59–61**, Indian Contract Act, 1872.

### ✅ **Legal Provisions**

---

### **🔹 Section 59 — Where Debtor Indicates**

If the debtor tells the creditor which debt the payment is for → creditor **must apply** it accordingly.

✔️ _Example:_  
A owes B Tk. 2,000 and Tk. 3,000. A pays Tk. 2,000 saying it’s for the first debt → B must adjust it against the Tk. 2,000 debt.

---

### **🔹 Section 60 — Where Debtor Does Not Indicate**

If the debtor **does not specify** → creditor may apply the payment to any debt due, even a **time-barred debt**.

✔️ _Example:_  
A owes B Tk. 5,000 (not time-barred) + Tk. 2,000 (time-barred). A pays Tk. 2,000 without instructions. B can adjust against the time-barred debt.

### **🔹 Section 61 — Neither Party Appropriates**

If neither party appropriates → payment is applied:

- In **order of time** (oldest debt first).
    
- If debts are of equal standing → equally between them.
    

✔️ _Example:_  
A owes B for 3 loans:

1. Tk. 1,000 (oldest)
    
2. Tk. 2,000
    
3. Tk. 3,000 (latest)
    

A pays Tk. 1,500 without instructions. B does not apply it. The law applies it:

- Tk. 1,000 to first debt.
    
- Tk. 500 to second debt.

### ✅ **Key Principles**

✔️ **Debtor’s right** to appropriate comes first.  
✔️ If debtor is silent → creditor gets next right.  
✔️ If both silent → law decides based on order of time.

---

### ✅ **Relevant Case**

**SBI v Ranjit Singh (1980)**  
The Supreme Court held that if the debtor does not direct, the creditor can adjust payment to any lawful debt — even one barred by limitation.

---

### ✏️ **Key Takeaways**

✔ When a debtor owes multiple debts, **payment must be appropriated**.  
✔ Debtor’s instructions control first.  
✔ If no instruction, creditor chooses.  
✔ If both silent, law adjusts by order of debts.
