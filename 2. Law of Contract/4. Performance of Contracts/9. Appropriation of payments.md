### üìå 4.9 Appropriation of payments ‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Not as Critical**: These are technical rules of accounting that apply to a very specific scenario: a debtor owing multiple debts to one creditor. While important for commercial and banking law, they are less foundational to the general principles of contract performance and are not as frequently tested as broader concepts.

Appropriation of payments deals with the question of which debt to pay off when a debtor owes several distinct debts to the same creditor and makes a payment that is insufficient to cover all of them. **Sections 59 to 61 of the Contract Act, 1872**, provide a clear, hierarchical set of rules to resolve this.

#### üü° The Hierarchy of Appropriation

The law provides a three-step sequence. If the first rule is not used, the right passes to the second, and then to the third.

##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Debtor's Intention (Section 59) 
The **first right** to decide which debt the payment should be applied to belongs to the **debtor**.

- **Express Appropriation**: The debtor can explicitly state which debt the payment is for (e.g., "This payment is for the March invoice").
    
- **Implied Appropriation**: If not stated, the debtor's intention can be implied from the circumstances. For example, if a debtor owes two debts of BDT 5,000 and BDT 8,750, and sends a cheque for exactly BDT 8,750, the law implies that the payment was for the second debt.
    

##### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Creditor's Discretion (Section 60) 
If the debtor makes a payment **without specifying** how it should be appropriated, the right to appropriate passes to the **creditor**.

- The creditor can apply the payment to any lawful debt which is due.
    
- **Important Power**: The creditor can even apply the payment to a debt that is **time-barred** (a debt that is so old the creditor can no longer sue for it).
    
- The creditor must, however, act reasonably and usually informs the debtor of the appropriation.
    

##### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Appropriation by Law (Section 61) 
If **neither the debtor nor the creditor** makes an appropriation, the law will step in and apply the payment automatically.

- The payment is to be applied in discharge of the debts in **chronological order** (oldest first).
    
- If the debts are of equal date, the payment will be applied proportionately among them.
    

In summary, the rule follows a logical order: **Debtor first, then Creditor, and finally, the Law.** This provides certainty and a clear mechanism for handling payments in multi-debt situations.
