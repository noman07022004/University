>**Why Important**: This concept, also known as **"tender,"** is a crucial legal principle that protects a promisor who is ready and willing to perform their obligations. It establishes that if a valid attempt to perform is rejected by the other party, the willing promisor is not considered in breach of contract. Understanding the requirements for a valid tender is key to determining who is at fault when a contract is not performed.

An "offer to perform" is a formal attempt by the promisor to fulfill their contractual promise. It is the promisor showing up, ready, willing, and able to perform their side of the bargain.

The primary legal effect is laid out in **Section 38 of the Contract Act, 1872**: If a promisor makes a valid offer to perform and the promisee rejects it, the promisor is discharged from liability for non-performance. They have done their part, and the responsibility now shifts to the promisee who refused to accept.

#### üü° Essentials of a Valid Tender

For an offer to perform to be legally valid and provide this protection, it must meet several conditions, which are also outlined in Section 38:

##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ It must be unconditional. 
The promisor cannot add any new conditions that were not part of the original agreement. The performance offered must be exactly what was promised.

- **Example**: If A is contracted to deliver 100 bags of rice to B for a certain price, A cannot make the delivery conditional on B signing an additional service agreement.
    

##### 2Ô∏è‚É£ It must be at a proper time and place. 
The tender must be made at the time and place stipulated in the contract. If no time or place is specified, it must be made at a reasonable place and during reasonable hours of business.

- **Example**: Offering to deliver construction materials to a work site at 11 PM, when the site is closed and no one is there to receive them, would not be a valid tender.
    

##### 3Ô∏è‚É£ It must give a reasonable opportunity for inspection. 
The promisee must be given a fair chance to ascertain that the goods or services being offered conform to the contract's requirements.

- **Example**: If a tailor offers to deliver a custom-made suit, the customer must be given a reasonable opportunity to inspect the suit and try it on before being required to accept it. A demand for payment before allowing any inspection would invalidate the tender.

#### üü° Types of Tender and Their Effects

It's important to distinguish between two types of tender:

##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Tender of Goods or Services: 
When a valid tender of goods or services is rejected, the promisor is completely discharged from their obligation to perform and can sue the promisee for breach of contract.
    
##### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Tender of Money: 
When a valid tender of payment is rejected by the creditor, the debtor is **not** discharged from the obligation to pay the principal amount. However, they are discharged from any liability for interest that would have accrued from the date of the valid tender.
