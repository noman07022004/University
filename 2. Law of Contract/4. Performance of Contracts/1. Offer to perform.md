## 📑 **4.1 Performance of Contracts: Offer to Perform**

---

### ✅ **Introduction**

The first step in performing a contract is **making an offer to perform** — also called a **tender of performance**.  
The promisor must **offer** to do what they promised. If they do this properly, and the promisee refuses — the promisor may be **discharged** from liability.

---

### ✅ **Legal Provision**

**📜 Sections 37 & 38**, Indian Contract Act, 1872:

- **Section 37:** Parties must perform or offer to perform their promises.
    
- **Section 38:** If a valid offer to perform is refused, the promisor is no longer responsible for non-performance.
    

---

### ✅ **What is a Valid Offer to Perform?**

An **offer to perform** (or _tender_) must be:

1️⃣ **Unconditional:** The offer must be without extra conditions not in the contract.  
2️⃣ **Proper time and place:** Must be made at the agreed or reasonable time and place.  
3️⃣ **Full Performance:** Must cover the whole promise, not just part.  
4️⃣ **Opportunity to inspect:** If goods are delivered, the promisee should have a chance to check them.  
5️⃣ **Person making the offer must be ready and willing** to perform.

---

**If all these are satisfied → It’s a valid tender.**

---

### ✅ **Effect of Refusal**

If the promisor makes a valid tender but the promisee **refuses**:

- The promisor is **excused** from further performance.
    
- But the promisor keeps the **right to sue** for breach.
    

**Exception:**  
If it’s payment of money → Refusal by the creditor does **not** discharge the debtor from liability — the debt still exists.

### ✅ **Examples**

**Example 1:**  
A agrees to deliver 50 bags of rice to B. A brings the rice on the agreed date and offers them to B. B refuses to accept.  
👉 A is discharged from the duty to deliver, but can sue B for breach.

---

**Example 2 (Payment):**  
X owes Y Tk. 1,000. X offers the money on due date, Y refuses. X is still liable — the debt remains, but X won’t pay extra interest from the date of tender.

---

### ✅ **Relevant Case**

**Startup v Macdonald (1843)** —  
A buyer refused to accept delivery because it was offered late in the day. Held: The seller had made a valid tender at a reasonable time, so he was discharged.

### 📌 **Tip**

✔ Always link **Sections 37 & 38**.  
✔ Emphasize that a valid tender excuses the promisor (except for money).  
✔ Use practical examples — delivery of goods, payment of debt.

---

### ✏️ **Key Takeaways**

✔ A promisor must offer to perform their promise properly.  
✔ If the promisee wrongly refuses, the promisor is free from obligation (except for payment of money).  
✔ Valid tender must be unconditional, complete, and at proper time/place.  
✔ The promisor may sue for breach if the promisee refuses.
