### üìå 4.4 Reciprocal promises ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: Most contracts aren't one-sided; they are built on a foundation of mutual promises. This topic provides the essential rules that govern the performance of these "I will if you will" agreements. Understanding the order and dependency of these promises is fundamental to figuring out who must act first and what happens if one party fails to hold up their end of the bargain.

**Reciprocal promises** are the heart of a bilateral contract. They are defined in **Section 2(f) of the Contract Act, 1872**, as "promises which form the consideration or part of the consideration for each other." In simple terms, it‚Äôs a set of promises where each party's promise is the "price" for the other's.

The key legal issue with reciprocal promises is the **order of performance**. The Contract Act (Sections 51-54) provides a clear framework for this.

#### üü° Types and Order of Performance

##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Simultaneous Performance (Mutual and Concurrent) 
**Section 51** states that when reciprocal promises are to be performed simultaneously, a promisor is not bound to perform unless the promisee is ready and willing to perform their side.

- **Rationale**: This rule protects both parties by ensuring neither has to give up their consideration without receiving the other's.
    
- **Classic Example**: A standard cash-on-delivery sale. The seller's promise to deliver the goods and the buyer's promise to pay the price are concurrent. The seller does not have to hand over the package unless the buyer is ready with the money, and the buyer does not have to pay until the seller is ready to deliver. üì¶ üíµ
    

##### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Performance where the Order is Fixed 
**Section 52** deals with situations where the contract expressly states the order in which the promises must be performed. In such cases, the order must be followed.

- **Example**: A construction contract where the owner agrees to pay 25% of the total price _after_ the foundation is completed. The builder must complete the foundation first; their performance is a condition precedent to the owner's duty to make that first payment.
    

##### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Performance of Dependent Promises 
**Section 54** covers promises where the performance of one is dependent on the prior performance of the other. If the party who is supposed to perform first fails to do so, they cannot demand performance from the other party. Furthermore, they are liable for any loss the other party suffers due to the non-performance.

- **Example**: A agrees to supply B with specific raw materials. B agrees to use those materials to manufacture a product and sell it back to A. If A fails to supply the raw materials, A cannot claim the finished product from B and must compensate B for any losses (e.g., idle factory time).

#### üü° Effect of Preventing Performance

**Section 53** addresses a situation where one party actively prevents the other from performing. In such a case, the contract becomes **voidable** at the option of the party who was prevented. The prevented party is also entitled to compensation for any loss they incurred.

- **Example**: A contracts to paint B's house for a fee. A arrives with all the necessary equipment, but B refuses to unlock the door and grant him access. B has prevented A from performing. A can now choose to cancel the contract and sue B for damages (e.g., for his lost time and profit).
