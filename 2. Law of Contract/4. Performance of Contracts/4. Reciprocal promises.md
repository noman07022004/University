## 📑 **4.4 Performance of Contracts: Reciprocal Promises**

---

### ✅ **Introduction**

**Reciprocal promises** = promises **which form the consideration or part of the consideration for each other**.

In simple words:  
➡️ _Each party’s promise is the reason the other party is willing to perform._  
➡️ _They depend on each other._

**Example:**  
A agrees to sell a bike to B for Tk. 20,000.  
A’s promise = to deliver the bike.  
B’s promise = to pay Tk. 20,000.  
Both promises are **reciprocal**.

### ✅ **Legal Provisions**

📜 **Sections 51–54**, Indian Contract Act, 1872:

---

### 🔹 **Types of Reciprocal Promises**

**Sec. 51–53** classify them into three:

1️⃣ **Mutual and Dependent Promises**

- Performance of one depends on performance by the other.
    
- If one party doesn’t perform → the other need not perform.
    

✔️ _Example:_  
A contracts to supply bricks to B if B supplies cement. If B doesn’t supply cement, A need not supply bricks.

---

2️⃣ **Mutual and Independent Promises**

- Each party must perform **independently**, regardless of whether the other does or not.
    

✔️ _Example:_  
A promises to deliver rice to B on 1st May. B promises to deliver wheat to A on 1st June. Both are separate.

---

3️⃣ **Mutual and Concurrent Promises**

- Must be performed **at the same time**.
    

✔️ _Example:_  
Sale of goods — buyer pays money and seller delivers goods **at the same time**.

---

### ✅ **Order of Performance — Section 52**

When the order is not clearly stated:  
➡️ Nature of transaction decides the order.

✔️ _Example:_  
A contracts to build a house for B, B promises to pay after completion. A must finish the house before demanding payment.

---

### ✅ **Effect of Preventing Performance — Section 53**

If one party prevents the other from performing:  
➡️ The prevented party may **void the contract** and claim compensation.

✔️ _Example:_  
A contracts with B to make a road on B’s land. B stops A from entering. A can void the contract and claim loss.

---

### ✅ **Performance of Reciprocal Promises — Section 54**

Where one party’s performance **cannot be done until the other has performed**:  
➡️ The first party must perform first.

✔️ _Example:_  
A contracts to repair B’s car after B provides spare parts. B must first provide parts.

### ✅ **Relevant Case**

**Planche v Colburn (1831)**  
An author contracted to write a book, but the publisher cancelled it. The court held that the author could claim for work done — because the publisher prevented performance.
