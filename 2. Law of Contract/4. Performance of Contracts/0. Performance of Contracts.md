## 📌 4. Performance of Contracts ⭐⭐⭐⭐

>**Why Important**: This topic is the practical heart of contract law. While "Formation" deals with creating a contract, "Performance" deals with fulfilling it. It covers the crucial questions of who must perform, what must be done, and when and where it must happen. Understanding these rules is essential for advising clients on their obligations and determining when a breach of contract has occurred.

The performance of a contract is the fulfillment of the legal obligations created by it. Once a valid contract is formed, the parties acquire rights and become subject to liabilities. The primary liability of each party is to perform their promise. This topic addresses the rules governing exactly how these promises are to be carried out.

### 🟡 The Core Obligation and Offer to Perform

The fundamental rule, stated in **Section 37 of the Contract Act, 1872**, is that parties to a contract must either perform or **offer to perform** their respective promises. This "offer to perform," also known as a **tender**, is crucial. If a promisor makes a valid offer to perform their obligation, and the promisee refuses to accept it, the promisor is not liable for non-performance and does not lose their rights under the contract. For a tender to be valid, it must be unconditional, made at the proper **time and place**, and must give the promisee a reasonable opportunity to inspect the goods or services.

### 🟡 Who Performs and What is Performed?

The **liability to perform** a contract generally rests with the promisor themselves, especially if the promise involves personal skill or diligence (e.g., a contract for painting a portrait). However, if the contract does not require personal performance, the promisor may employ a competent person to perform it.

Many contracts involve **joint rights and liabilities**, where two or more people make a joint promise. In such cases, the promisee can compel any one of the joint promisors to perform the whole promise. The promisor who performs can then claim contribution from the other joint promisors.

A significant number of contracts are built on **reciprocal promises**, where each party's promise is the consideration for the other's (e.g., a contract of sale). The order of performance for these promises depends on the contract's terms. They may be mutual and independent, conditional and dependent (where one party must perform first), or mutual and concurrent (where they must be performed simultaneously, like payment and delivery of goods).

### 🟡 When Performance is Not Required

While performance is the primary goal, there are situations where **contracts need not be performed**. This occurs if the parties agree to substitute a new contract for the old one (**novation**), to cancel it (**rescission**), or to alter its terms (**alteration**). If the promisee agrees to dispense with or remit the performance, the contract is also discharged. These methods of discharge by mutual agreement are covered in more detail under "Termination of Contract."

### 🟡 Transfer and Timing of Performance

The rights and obligations under a contract can sometimes be transferred. While contractual liabilities involving personal skill cannot be transferred, contractual rights, such as the right to receive a payment, can generally be transferred through an **assignment of contracts**.

The **time and place of performance** are critical. If the contract specifies a time, it must be performed then. If no time is specified, it must be performed within a reasonable time. The question of whether **performance within a stipulated time** is essential depends on the parties' intention. In commercial contracts, time is generally considered to be "of the essence," meaning a failure to perform on time is a breach of a fundamental term.

Finally, when a debtor owes several distinct debts to a creditor and makes a payment, rules on the **appropriation of payments** (Sections 59-61) determine which debt the payment should be applied to. The debtor has the first right to specify, but if they don't, the creditor may apply it. If neither party does, the law applies it in chronological order of the debts.
