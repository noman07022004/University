## 🎯 **Bigger Picture: 4. Performance of Contracts**

---

### ✅ **What is Performance?**

Once a contract is formed, the next step is **performance** — actually **carrying out the promises** made in the contract.  
It is the **fulfillment of contractual obligations** by the parties.

---

**Example:**  
If A agrees to sell a bike to B for Tk. 10,000 —  
👉 **Performance** means A delivers the bike & B pays the money.

---

### ✅ **Why is it important?**

- **Performance** is the main way contracts come to an end.
    
- If parties perform as agreed → contract is **discharged**.
    
- If performance fails → breach → remedies.
    

---

### ✅ **Key Focus Areas**

The Indian Contract Act explains:

1️⃣ **Who must perform?** — The promisor themselves, agent, or legal representative?  
2️⃣ **To whom must performance be made?**  
3️⃣ **When and where?** — Time and place matter.  
4️⃣ **How?** — Exact manner agreed or as reasonable.  
5️⃣ **What happens if performance is not needed?** — E.g., by mutual agreement, impossibility, or valid excuses.

### ✅ **Relevant Sections**

**Sections 37–67**, Indian Contract Act, 1872, mainly cover performance:

- **Sec. 37:** Obligation to perform.
    
- **Sec. 38–50:** Who performs and how.
    
- **Sec. 51–67:** Reciprocal promises, joint liabilities, time and place, appropriations.
    

---

### ✅ **Practical Significance**

✔ Helps you decide **who is responsible** if something goes wrong.  
✔ Clarifies **joint promises** — when more than one person is involved.  
✔ Explains **rights and duties** about time, place, and partial performance.  
✔ Connects to **breach** if obligations are not met.

### 🔑 **Big Idea:**

_The contract ends by performance — if not, the party failing may face legal consequences._
