## 📑 **4.3 Performance of Contracts: Joint Rights and Liabilities**

---

### ✅ **Introduction**

Many contracts involve **more than one promisor or promisee**.  
👉 So, who is liable to perform? Who can demand performance?  
👉 This is about **joint promises**, **joint liabilities**, and **joint rights** — mainly under **Sections 42–45** of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.

### ✅ **Key Provisions**

**📜 Section 42–45**, Indian Contract Act, 1872:

---

**🔹 Section 42 — Devolution of Joint Liabilities**

If two or more persons make a joint promise:

- All must perform it **together** (jointly).
    
- If one dies, the survivor(s) and legal representatives must perform.
    

---

**🔹 Section 43 — Any One Can Be Compelled**

The promisee may **compel any one** or more of the joint promisors to perform the whole promise.

**Example:**  
A, B, and C jointly promise to pay Tk. 30,000. The promisee can demand the full amount from A alone, or A & B, or A & C — **any one or all**.

---

**🔹 Right to Contribution**

If one joint promisor pays more than his share, he can demand **contribution** from the others.

**Example:**  
If A pays the whole Tk. 30,000 → A can recover Tk. 10,000 each from B & C.

---

**🔹 Section 44 — Release of One Promisor**

If the promisee **releases** one joint promisor, the others remain liable.  
The released promisor is still liable to contribute to other promisors.

---

**🔹 Section 45 — Joint Promisees**

When a promise is made to several promisees:

- They must **all demand performance jointly**.
    
- On death, the right passes to the **survivors**, then to representatives.
    

**Example:**  
A promises to pay Tk. 50,000 to B and C. Both B & C must claim it jointly. If B dies, C and B’s legal heirs can claim together.

---

### ✅ **Examples**

**Example 1:**  
X, Y, Z promise to build a wall for P. P can make X alone build it if needed.

---

**Example 2:**  
If one promisor is released by P, the other promisors remain bound.

---

### ✅ **Why Joint Rights & Liabilities Matter**

✔ Ensures that a promisee can get full benefit — even if one promisor fails.  
✔ Protects fairness between promisors — right to contribution.  
✔ Prevents a promisee from losing rights if one promisee dies.

---

### ✅ **Relevant Case**

**Khushal Chand v Durga Prasad (1911)**  
— One co-promisor was released, court held others remain liable.

---

### ✏️ **Key Takeaways**

✔ Joint promisors: all liable together & individually.  
✔ Promisee can sue any one or all.  
✔ Paying promisor can recover from co-promisors.  
✔ Joint promisees must claim together — right survives.
