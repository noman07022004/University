### üìå 4.3 Joint rights and liabilities ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: Contracts don't always involve just one person on each side. This topic explains the crucial rules for enforcing promises made by or to multiple parties. The concept of "joint and several" liability, in particular, is a cornerstone of commercial law, as it gives the creditor significant power to recover a debt.

This topic deals with situations where two or more people together make a promise (joint promisors) or where a promise is made to two or more people together (joint promisees). The rules are laid out in **Sections 42 to 45 of the Contract Act, 1872**.

#### üü° Joint Liabilities (When Multiple People Make a Promise)

This is governed by **Section 43** and is the most significant part of this topic. When two or more persons make a joint promise, the rules are as follows:

##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Any One Promisor Can Be Compelled to Perform 
The promisee (the creditor) has the right to demand performance of the _entire_ promise from any **one** of the joint promisors. They do not have to sue all of them. This is often called **"joint and several" liability**.

- **Example**: A, B, and C jointly promise to pay D BDT 90,000. D can choose to sue just A for the full BDT 90,000. D is not legally required to also sue B and C. This gives the creditor a powerful and convenient way to recover the debt. üèõÔ∏è
    

##### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Right to Contribution 
A joint promisor who has been forced to perform the entire promise has the right to demand a proportionate contribution from the other joint promisors.

- **Example (continued)**: If D recovers the full BDT 90,000 from A, A can then sue B to contribute his share (BDT 30,000) and sue C to contribute his share (BDT 30,000). This ensures fairness among the co-promisors.
    

##### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Sharing of Loss 
If one of the joint promisors defaults on their contribution (e.g., due to insolvency), the remaining joint promisors must bear that loss in equal shares.

- **Example (continued)**: If C becomes insolvent and cannot pay his BDT 30,000 share, this loss must be shared equally by A and B. A would bear BDT 15,000 of C's share, and B would have to contribute BDT 15,000 for C's share. So, B would now owe A a total of BDT 45,000 (his original 30k + 15k for C's share).

#### üü° Joint Rights (When a Promise is Made to Multiple People)

This is governed by **Section 45**. When a promise is made to several persons jointly, the right to demand performance rests with **all of them together**.

- **Example**: X promises to pay BDT 50,000 to Y and Z jointly. To recover the money, Y and Z must sue X **together**. Y cannot sue alone for BDT 25,000.
    
- **Effect of Death**: If one of the joint promisees dies (e.g., Y), the right to sue passes to their legal representative, who must then join with the surviving promisee (Z) to file the lawsuit.
