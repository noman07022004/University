## 📑 **4.2 Performance of Contracts: Liability to Perform**

---

### ✅ **Introduction**

**Liability to perform** means:  
**Who is legally bound to perform** a contract, and in what situations the obligation continues — even if the original promisor dies or becomes incapable.

This clarifies **who must do what** under the contract.

---

### ✅ **Legal Basis**

**📜 Section 37**, Indian Contract Act, 1872:

> _“The parties to a contract must either perform, or offer to perform, their respective promises, unless such performance is dispensed with or excused under the provisions of this Act, or of any other law.”_

This sets out the basic rule: **Promises must be performed** or a valid excuse must exist.

---

### ✅ **Who Must Perform?**

---

**1️⃣ Promisor Himself**  
➡️ If personal skill or personal trust is involved.  
**Example:**  
A promises to paint B’s portrait. A must do it himself.

---

**2️⃣ Agent**  
➡️ If the promise **does not involve personal skill**, the promisor may perform through an agent.  
**Example:**  
A contracts to deliver goods to B. A can use a delivery company.

---

**3️⃣ Legal Representatives**  
➡️ If the promisor dies, their legal representatives must perform, **unless it involves personal skill** or is otherwise discharged.  
**Example:**  
A promises to pay B Tk. 5,000. A dies. A’s heirs must pay from A’s estate.

---

**4️⃣ Joint Promisors**  
➡️ If several people promise jointly, each is liable **jointly and severally** (together and individually).

---

### ✅ **When is Liability Discharged?**

Liability to perform ends when:  
✔ The promise is properly performed.  
✔ Performance is offered but refused (valid tender).  
✔ It is **excused by law** — e.g., impossibility, frustration, waiver.

---

### ✅ **Key Principle**

**Personal Contracts Die with the Promisor**  
✔ If the promise is **personal in nature** — e.g., singing, painting — it cannot be performed by heirs or agents.

---

### ✅ **Relevant Case**

**Robson v Drummond (1831)** —  
A hired a carriage for personal use. The contract was held to be personal, so the promisor could not transfer his obligation to another.

### ✅ **Possible Exam Question**

---

### 📌 **Tip**

✔ Link it to **Section 37**.  
✔ Explain **self-performance**, **agent**, and **legal representatives**.  
✔ Personal skill → only the promisor can perform.

---

### ✏️ **Key Takeaways**

✔ Every promisor must perform or offer to perform.  
✔ If the promise involves personal skill, it must be done personally.  
✔ Legal reps are bound unless the contract is personal.  
✔ Joint promisors are **jointly and severally liable**.
