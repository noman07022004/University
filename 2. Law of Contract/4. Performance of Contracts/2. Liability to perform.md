### üìå 4.2 Liability to perform ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: This topic answers the fundamental question of _who_ is bound to carry out a contractual promise. It establishes a critical distinction between contracts that require a personal touch and those that do not, which has significant consequences for delegation, substitution, and what happens if a promisor dies.

The liability to perform a contract rests primarily on the promisor. However, whether the promisor must perform the act _personally_ depends entirely on the nature of the contract. This distinction is the core of **Section 40 of the Contract Act, 1872**.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Contracts Involving Personal Skill

If it appears from the nature of the case that the contract was intended to be performed by the promisor themselves, then they must do so personally. This applies to contracts where the promisor's unique skill, qualification, taste, or expertise is the basis of the agreement.

- **Rationale**: The promisee specifically bargained for that individual's talent and is not required to accept performance from anyone else.
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - A contract with a famous artist to paint a portrait. üé®
        
    - A contract with a renowned architect to design a building.
        
    - A contract for a surgeon to perform a specific operation. ü©∫
        
- **Effect of Death**: In such contracts, the death of the promisor **discharges the contract**. The liability does not pass to their legal heirs, as they cannot be expected to possess the same personal skills.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Contracts Not Involving Personal Skill

If the contract is of a nature that can be performed by any competent person, the promisor is not required to perform it personally. The promisor has two options:

- Perform the promise themselves.
    
- Employ a competent person (an agent or delegate) to perform it.
    
- **Rationale**: Here, the promisee is concerned with the _result_ of the promise, not the specific person who performs it.
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - A contract to pay a sum of money.
        
    - A contract to deliver standard goods, like cement or bricks. üß±
        
    - A contract to carry out a routine repair.
        
- **Effect of Death**: In these cases, the death of the promisor does **not** discharge the contract. The liability to perform passes to the promisor's **legal representatives**, who must either perform the contract or arrange for its performance using the assets of the deceased's estate.

#### üü° Accepting Performance from a Third Party

**Section 41** adds an important related rule: If a promisee accepts performance of the promise from a third person, they cannot afterwards enforce it against the original promisor.

- **Example**: A owes B a debt of BDT 5,000. C, a friend of A, pays the full amount to B, and B accepts the payment. B has now been satisfied and cannot sue A for the same debt. By accepting the performance from C, B has effectively discharged A's liability.
