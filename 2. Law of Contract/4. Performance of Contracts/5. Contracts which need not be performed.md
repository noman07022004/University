## 📑 **4.5 Performance of Contracts: Contracts Which Need Not Be Performed**

---

### ✅ **Introduction**

Sometimes, a valid contract **does not have to be performed** because:

- The parties **mutually agree** to change or end it.
    
- The law excuses performance.
    
- Performance becomes **impossible** by law.
    

This section explains **when performance is no longer required** under the Indian Contract Act.

---

### ✅ **Legal Provisions**

📜 **Sections 62–67**, Indian Contract Act, 1872

These sections explain **substituted performance, rescission, alteration, remission, waiver**, and **voidable contracts**.

---

### 🔹 **Key Situations When Contract Need Not Be Performed**

---

**1️⃣ Novation (Sec. 62)**  
When the parties **substitute a new contract** for the old one → the old one need not be performed.

✔️ _Example:_  
A owes B Tk. 10,000. A, B, and C agree that C will pay B instead of A. Original contract ends.

---

**2️⃣ Rescission (Sec. 62)**  
When parties **mutually agree to cancel** the contract → no need to perform.

✔️ _Example:_  
A and B enter into a contract. Later, both agree to call it off. Neither must perform.

---

**3️⃣ Alteration (Sec. 62)**  
When the terms of a contract are **changed by agreement**, the old contract ends → new terms bind the parties.

✔️ _Example:_  
A contracts to build B’s house for Tk. 5,00,000. Later, both agree to increase it to Tk. 6,00,000 with extra work. Old contract is replaced.

---

**4️⃣ Remission (Sec. 63)**  
A promisee may accept **less than what is due**, or extend time, or accept other satisfaction.

✔️ _Example:_  
A owes B Tk. 10,000. B accepts Tk. 7,000 in full satisfaction. A need not pay the rest.

---

**5️⃣ Waiver**  
A promisee may choose to **waive performance altogether**.

✔️ _Example:_  
A owes B Tk. 5,000. B says “Forget it.” A is free.

---

**6️⃣ Voidable Contract (Sec. 64)**  
If one party rescinds a **voidable contract**, the other need not perform.

✔️ _Example:_  
A is forced to sign a contract by B. A rescinds the contract → A need not perform.

---

**7️⃣ Impossibility (Sec. 56)**  
Performance becomes **impossible** due to an event beyond control → contract ends.

✔️ _Example:_  
A contracts to sing for B. A becomes seriously ill → A need not perform.

---

### ✅ **Relevant Case**

**Lufthansa German Airlines v Airport Authority of India (2005)**  
— The court held that if parties mutually agree to substitute a contract, the original contract need not be performed.
