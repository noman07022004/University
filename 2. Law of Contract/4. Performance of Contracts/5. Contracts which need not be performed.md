### üìå 4.5 Contracts which need not be performed ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: While performance is the natural end for most contracts, it's not the only one. This topic is important because it explains how parties can use their freedom of contract to mutually agree to end or change their obligations before performance is complete. These concepts‚Äînovation, rescission, and alteration‚Äîare fundamental methods of discharging a contract by agreement.

The basic principle is that a contract, created by the mutual consent of the parties, can also be brought to an end by their mutual consent. The obligation to perform is extinguished when the parties agree to a new arrangement. These methods are primarily covered in **Sections 62 and 63 of the Contract Act, 1872**.

#### üü° Methods of Discharge by Agreement

##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Novation (Section 62) 
Novation means substituting an existing contract with a **new contract**. The original contract is completely discharged and need not be performed. The consideration for the new contract is the discharge of the old one. Novation can occur in two ways:

- **By changing the terms**: The parties remain the same, but the material terms of the contract are so significantly changed that they effectively create a new agreement.
    
- **By changing the parties**: The terms may remain the same, but one of the original parties is replaced by a new one, with the consent of all involved.
    
    **Example**: A is indebted to B. C is indebted to A. All three parties agree that B will now accept C as his debtor, and A will be released from the debt. The original contract between A and B need not be performed.
    

##### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Rescission (Section 62) 
Rescission means the **cancellation** of the contract by mutual consent. The parties agree to undo the contract and relieve each other of their obligations.

- **Example**: A promises to deliver goods to B on a future date. Before that date arrives, A and B mutually agree that they no longer wish to proceed with the transaction. The contract is rescinded, and neither party has to perform.
    

##### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Alteration (Section 62) 
Alteration involves changing one or more of the terms of the original contract with the consent of all parties.

- **Distinction from Novation**: In alteration, the original contract continues to exist, just in a modified form. In novation, the original contract is entirely extinguished and replaced.
    
- **Example**: A agrees to supply B with 100 sacks of rice by September 1st. Later, they mutually agree to change the delivery date to October 1st. The contract has been altered, but it is still the same underlying contract.
    

##### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Remission (Section 63) 
Remission is the acceptance of a **lesser fulfillment** of the promise made. The promisee can agree to accept less than what is due, extend the time for performance, or accept some other form of satisfaction.

- **Key Feature**: A crucial aspect of Section 63 in Bangladesh (and India) is that a promise to accept less **does not require any new consideration** to be binding. This is a significant departure from English law.
    
- **Example**: A owes B BDT 10,000. B agrees to accept BDT 6,000 in full and final settlement of the debt. A pays the BDT 6,000. The entire debt of BDT 10,000 is discharged. A is no longer required to perform the rest of the original promise. üí∏
