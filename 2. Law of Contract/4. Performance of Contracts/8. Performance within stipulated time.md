### 📌 4.8 Performance within stipulated time ⭐⭐⭐⭐

>**Why Important**: Deadlines are a critical part of many contracts. This topic addresses the severe legal consequences of failing to perform on time. It introduces the fundamental concept of "time is of the essence," which determines whether a delay is a minor hiccup entitling the other party to compensation, or a major breach that gives them the right to cancel the entire contract.

When a contract specifies a time for performance, the legal effect of a delay depends on whether the parties intended **time to be of the essence** of the contract. This is governed by **Section 55 of the Contract Act, 1872**.

#### 🟡 Scenario 1: Where Time IS of the Essence

If the parties intended that the deadline be strictly followed, then "time is of the essence." In this situation, a failure to perform within the specified time makes the contract **voidable** at the option of the promisee (the innocent party).

This means the promisee has two choices:

1. **Cancel the Contract**: They can treat the contract as broken (rescind it) and sue the promisor for damages resulting from the breach.
    
2. **Accept the Delayed Performance**: They can waive the breach and allow the promisor to perform late. However, if they choose this, they cannot later claim compensation for the delay **unless**, at the time of accepting the late performance, they give notice to the promisor of their intention to do so.
    

**When is time considered "of the essence"?**

- When the contract explicitly says so (e.g., "Time is of the essence").
    
- When the nature of the contract implies it. The general rule is that in **commercial and business contracts**, time is presumed to be of the essence, as prices and circumstances can change rapidly. 📈
    

**Example**: A contracts to supply B with raw materials to be delivered on September 8th, knowing that B needs them to fulfill a large order on September 10th. A fails to deliver on the 8th. Here, time is clearly of the essence. B can cancel the contract with A, find another supplier, and sue A for any extra costs and losses.

#### 🟡 Scenario 2: Where Time is NOT of the Essence

If the parties did not intend for the deadline to be a strict condition, then a failure to perform on time does **not** make the contract voidable.

The promisee **cannot** cancel the contract. They are obligated to accept the delayed performance. However, they are entitled to **compensation** for any loss that the delay has caused them.

**When is time generally _not_ of the essence?**

- In contracts for the **sale of immovable property** (like land or a house), courts generally presume that time is not of the essence, unless the contract explicitly states otherwise or the circumstances make the deadline critical.
    

**Example**: A agrees to sell his apartment to B, with the final transfer of ownership scheduled for October 1st. Due to a banking delay, A is only ready on October 5th. B cannot cancel the entire deal. B must proceed with the purchase but can claim compensation from A for any losses caused by the 4-day delay (e.g., extra rent paid).
