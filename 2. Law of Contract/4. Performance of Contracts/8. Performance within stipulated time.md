## 📑 **4.8 Performance of Contracts: Performance Within Stipulated Time**

---

### ✅ **Introduction**

**Timely performance** is an important part of any contract.

➡️ When a contract specifies a **time limit** for performance:

- Parties must perform within that time.
    
- If they fail, it may lead to a **breach** or loss of rights.
    

The **Indian Contract Act, 1872** deals with this mainly under **Sections 55 and 46–50**.

---

### ✅ **What is “Stipulated Time”?**

➡️ A contract may fix:

- **Time for performance of the whole contract**, or
    
- **Time for parts of the performance** (e.g., delivery in stages).
    

---

### ✅ **When Time is “of the Essence” — Section 55**

**Section 55**:

- If **time is of the essence** — and a party fails → the contract becomes **voidable** at the option of the promisee.
    
- The promisee can:  
    ✔️ Rescind the contract, **OR**  
    ✔️ Accept delayed performance + claim compensation.

### 🔹 **Example:**

A contracts to deliver wedding dresses to B by 1st June. Dresses arrive on 5th June. Time is crucial → B can refuse delivery or accept it with compensation.

---

### ✅ **When Time is NOT “of the Essence”**

➡️ In some contracts (like construction or building contracts), time is usually **not essential** unless clearly stated.

➡️ In that case, late performance does **not make the contract voidable**, but the promisee can claim **damages**.

---

**Example:**  
A contracts to build a house for B by December. Work finishes in January. B can’t cancel the contract, but can claim loss for delay.

---

### ✅ **Acceptance of Late Performance**

If the promisee **accepts** delayed performance:

- They **cannot later cancel** the contract.
    
- But they can claim **compensation** for loss caused by the delay.
    

✔️ _Example:_  
A delivers goods late, B accepts them → B can’t refuse payment but may deduct loss caused by delay.

---

### ✅ **Relevant Case**

**Behari Lal v Ram Gopal (1948)**  
Held: If the promisee accepts late performance **without protest**, they waive the right to void the contract for delay — but can claim damages.

---

### ✅ **Difference from Sec. 46–50**

- **Sections 46–50** deal with _general rules_ for time and place.
    
- **Section 55** specifically deals with **consequences of delay** when time is fixed.

### ✅ **Possible Exam Question**

> _“Discuss the effect of failure to perform within stipulated time under Section 55 of the Indian Contract Act.”_

### 📌 **Tip**

✔ State if **time is essential** depends on contract terms + nature.  
✔ For commercial/perishable goods → time is usually essential.  
✔ For building contracts → time usually not essential.

---

### ✏️ **Key Takeaways**

✔ If time is of the essence → delay makes contract voidable.  
✔ Promisee can accept late work + claim damages.  
✔ If time is not essential → only damages, not rescission.  
✔ Section 55 = main section for exam.
