Of course. Let's cover the next subtopic.

### **8.6 Rights and duties of finder of goods** ⭐⭐

**Why Not as Critical**: While this is an interesting application of bailment principles, the scenario of finding lost goods and the ensuing legal rights is less common in commercial practice and examinations compared to standard bailment or pledge agreements.

A person who finds goods belonging to another and takes them into their custody is called a "finder of goods." **Section 71 of the Contract Act, 1872**, states that a finder of goods has the same responsibility as a **bailee**. This creates a quasi-contract of bailment by operation of law.

#### **Duties of a Finder of Goods**

1. **Duty to Take Reasonable Care**: The finder must take reasonable care of the goods, just like a bailee.
    
2. **Duty to Find the True Owner**: They must take reasonable steps to trace and find the actual owner of the goods.
    
3. **Duty Not to Use the Goods**: The finder must not use the goods for their own personal purposes.
    
4. **Duty Not to Mix Goods**: They must not mix the found goods with their own goods.
    

#### **Rights of a Finder of Goods**

1. **Right of Lien (Section 168)**: The finder has the right to retain the goods against the owner until they receive compensation for the trouble and expense incurred in preserving the goods and finding the owner. This is a **particular lien**, meaning it only applies to those specific expenses.
    
2. **Right to Sue for Reward (Section 168)**: If the owner has offered a specific reward for the return of the lost goods, the finder can sue for that reward and can retain the goods until the reward is paid.
    
3. **Right of Sale (Section 169)**: This is a crucial right. A finder of goods can sell the goods under two conditions:
    
    - If the owner cannot be found with reasonable diligence, **OR** if the owner refuses to pay the lawful charges of the finder.
        
    - **AND** one of the following is also true:
        
        - The item is in danger of perishing or losing the greater part of its value.
            
        - The lawful charges of the finder amount to two-thirds of the value of the item.
