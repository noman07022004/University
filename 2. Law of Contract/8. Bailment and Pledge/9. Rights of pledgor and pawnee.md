### **8.9 Rights of pledgor and pawnee** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: The rights of the pledgor and pawnee are the essence of the pledge agreement. The pawnee's powerful right to sell the secured goods is what makes a pledge an effective form of security for a loan. Conversely, the pledgor's right of redemption is their fundamental entitlement to get their property back.

#### **Rights of the Pawnee (The Lender)**

1. **Right to Retain the Goods (Section 173)** The pawnee has the right to retain the pledged goods until the principal debt, interest, and any necessary expenses incurred for the preservation of the goods are paid.
    
2. **Right in Case of Default (Section 176)** This is the pawnee's most important right. If the pledgor fails to pay the debt at the stipulated time, the pawnee has two options:
    
    - **(a) Sue for the Debt**: They can file a lawsuit against the pledgor for the amount of the debt, while still retaining the pledged goods as collateral security.
        
    - **(b) Sell the Goods**: They can sell the pledged goods after giving the pledgor **reasonable notice** of the sale.
        
    
    **After the Sale**:
    
    - If the sale proceeds are _less_ than the amount due, the pawnee can still sue the pledgor for the remaining balance.
        
    - If the sale proceeds are _more_ than the amount due, the pawnee must pay the surplus back to the pledgor.

#### **Rights of the Pledgor (The Borrower)**

1. **Right of Redemption (Section 177)** This is the pledgor's primary and absolute right. The pledgor has the right to get their goods back by paying the debt at any time **before the pawnee has actually sold them**.
    
    - **Late Payment**: Even if the pledgor defaults on the payment by the due date, their right to redeem the goods is not extinguished. It only ends when the pawnee has completed the sale of the goods. However, the pledgor must pay any extra expenses that have arisen from their default.
        
2. **Right to Receive Notice of Sale** The pledgor has a right to receive reasonable notice before the pawnee sells the goods. This gives them a final opportunity to redeem the goods by paying the debt.
