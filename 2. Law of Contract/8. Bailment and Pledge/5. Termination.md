### **8.5 Termination** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Why Important**: This topic explains how and when the legal relationship of bailment comes to an end. Understanding the grounds for termination is crucial for both the bailor and the bailee to know when their respective rights and duties are discharged and when a breach leading to early termination has occurred.

A bailment is terminated when the legal relationship between the bailor and bailee ends. This can happen in several ways:

1. **On the Expiry of the Period** If the bailment was for a specific period of time, it terminates automatically when that period expires.
    
    - **Example**: You hire a car for three days. The bailment ends after the third day.
        
2. **On the Achievement of the Object** If the bailment was for a specific purpose, it terminates as soon as that purpose is accomplished.
    
    - **Example**: You give your watch to a watchmaker for repair. The bailment terminates once the repair is complete.
        
3. **By Unauthorized Use (Bailor's Option)** According to **Section 153**, if the bailee does any act with regard to the goods that is inconsistent with the terms of the bailment, the bailor can choose to terminate the contract.
    
    - **Example**: A lends his car to B for personal use only. B uses the car as a taxi. A has the right to terminate the bailment immediately. üöñ
        
4. **By Destruction of the Subject Matter** If the subject matter of the bailment (the goods) is destroyed or becomes incapable of being used for the intended purpose, the contract of bailment is terminated.
    
5. **Termination of a Gratuitous Bailment (Section 159)** A gratuitous bailment (one made for free) can be terminated by the **bailor** at any time, even if it was for a specified time or purpose. However, if the early termination causes a loss to the bailee that is greater than the benefit they received, the bailor must compensate the bailee for that loss.
