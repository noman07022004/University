### **8.1 Definition** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Why Important**: The definition of bailment is crucial because it establishes the legal framework for countless everyday transactions. It clarifies when a simple transfer of goods creates a special legal relationship with specific rights and duties, distinguishing it from a sale or other types of transfers.

**Bailment** is the delivery of goods by one person to another for a specific purpose, with the condition that once the purpose is achieved, the goods will be returned or disposed of as directed by the person who delivered them.

The definition is provided in **Section 148 of the Contract Act, 1872**.

#### **Parties to Bailment**

- **Bailor**: The person who delivers the goods.
    
- **Bailee**: The person to whom the goods are delivered.

#### **Essential Characteristics**

1. **Contract**: Bailment is usually based on a contract, which can be express or implied.
    
2. **Delivery of Goods**: There must be a transfer of **possession** of movable goods from the bailor to the bailee. A mere custody without possession (e.g., a servant holding their master's umbrella) is not bailment.
    
3. **Specific Purpose**: The goods are delivered for a specific, temporary purpose (e.g., repair, safekeeping, transport). üì¶
    
4. **Return of Goods**: It is essential that the bailee is obligated to return the **same goods** to the bailor after the purpose is fulfilled. If the agreement is to return something equivalent but not the same (e.g., returning a different bag of rice of the same quality), it is not a bailment.
    
5. **Ownership is Not Transferred**: The bailor remains the owner of the goods. Only possession is transferred to the bailee.
    

**Classic Example**: When you give your laptop to a repair shop, you are the **bailor**, and the shop is the **bailee**. They have **possession** of the laptop for the **purpose** of repair and are obligated to **return** the same laptop to you once the repair is done.
