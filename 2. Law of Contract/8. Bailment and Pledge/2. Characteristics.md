### **8.2 Characteristics** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Why Important**: This topic breaks down the definition of bailment into its essential components. Understanding these specific characteristics is key to identifying whether a bailment relationship exists in a given scenario, which in turn determines the rights and duties of the parties involved.

The essential characteristics or elements of a valid bailment are as follows:

1. **Contract (Express or Implied)** A bailment is created by an agreement between the bailor and the bailee. This contract can be expressly stated or implied by the actions of the parties.
    
2. **Delivery of Possession** There must be a transfer of **possession** of movable goods. This is the most critical feature. The bailor must deliver the goods to the bailee, giving them control over the items.
    
    - **Example**: Handing your car keys to a valet is a delivery of possession. Leaving your car in a public parking lot where you keep the keys is not. üîë
        
3. **Movable Goods Only** Bailment only applies to movable property (goods), not to immovable property like land or buildings.
    
4. **Specific Purpose** The delivery of goods must be for a temporary and specific purpose, such as safekeeping, repair, transportation, or use.
    
5. **Return of the Specific Goods** It is a core condition of bailment that the **same goods** delivered will be returned to the bailor or disposed of according to their instructions once the purpose is achieved. If an equivalent item is to be returned (e.g., a bag of wheat in exchange for another bag of wheat), it is not a bailment.
    
    - **Example**: Depositing money in a bank is **not** a bailment because the bank does not return the exact same currency notes. It creates a debtor-creditor relationship.
        
6. **No Transfer of Ownership** The bailor remains the legal owner of the goods. Only possession is transferred to the bailee.
