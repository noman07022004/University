### **8.4 Rights and duties of a bailee and a bailor** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Why Important**: This is the operational core of the law of bailment. It outlines the specific legal responsibilities and entitlements of both parties. Nearly all legal disputes in bailment cases revolve around whether a duty was breached or a right was violated. Understanding these is essential for any practical application of bailment law.

### **Duties and Rights of the Bailee (The Receiver)**

#### **Duties of the Bailee**

1. **Duty to Take Reasonable Care (Sec 151)**: This is the most important duty. The bailee must take as much care of the goods as a person of ordinary prudence would take of their own goods of the same type and value. The standard is one of **reasonableness**, not absolute liability.
    
2. **Duty Not to Make Unauthorized Use (Sec 154)**: The bailee must use the goods only for the specific purpose for which they were bailed. If they make an unauthorized use, they are liable for any damage that occurs, even if they were not negligent.
    
    - **Example**: A lends his car to B for B's personal use. B uses the car for racing. If the car is damaged, B is liable, even if the accident wasn't his fault.
        
3. **Duty Not to Mix Goods (Sec 155-157)**: The bailee must keep the bailed goods separate from their own. If they mix them with the bailor's consent, they have a shared interest. If they mix them _without_ consent and the goods can be separated, the bailee bears the cost of separation. If the goods cannot be separated, the bailee must compensate the bailor for the entire loss of the goods.
    
4. **Duty to Return the Goods (Sec 160)**: After the purpose is accomplished or the time has expired, the bailee must return the goods to the bailor without demand.
    
5. **Duty to Return Accretions (Sec 163)**: The bailee must return any natural increase or profit that has accrued from the goods during the period of bailment.
    
    - **Example**: If a cow is bailed and it gives birth to a calf, the bailee must return both the cow and the calf. üêÆ
        

#### **Rights of the Bailee**

1. **Right to Compensation**: For a non-gratuitous bailment, the bailee has a right to receive the agreed-upon payment for their services.
    
2. **Right to Recover Expenses**: The bailee has the right to be reimbursed for any necessary expenses they have incurred for the purpose of the bailment.
    
3. **Right of Lien (Sec 170-171)**: If the bailee's lawful charges are not paid, they have the right to retain the goods until the payment is made. This is known as a **lien**. For example, a tailor can keep a suit until the stitching charges are paid.

### **Duties and Rights of the Bailor (The Giver)**

#### **Duties of the Bailor**

1. **Duty to Disclose Faults (Sec 150)**: The bailor must disclose any known faults in the goods that could pose a risk to the bailee. If they fail to do so, they are liable for any damage arising from those faults.
    
2. **Duty to Bear Expenses**: In a gratuitous bailment, the bailor must repay the bailee for any extraordinary expenses incurred. In a non-gratuitous bailment, the bailor is expected to bear the ordinary and reasonable expenses.
    
3. **Duty to Indemnify**: The bailor must compensate the bailee for any loss suffered because the bailor did not have the right to make the bailment in the first place.
    

#### **Rights of the Bailor**

1. **Right to Demand Return of Goods**: The bailor has the right to have the goods returned to them once the purpose of the bailment is complete.
    
2. **Right to Terminate the Contract**: In a gratuitous bailment, the bailor can demand the return of the goods at any time.
    
3. **Right to Compensation**: The bailor has the right to be compensated for any damage to the goods caused by the bailee's negligence or unauthorized use.
