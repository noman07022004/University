Of course. Let's cover the next subtopic.

### **8.7 Suits against wrongdoer** ⭐⭐

**Why Not as Critical**: This is a procedural topic that explains who has the right to take legal action if a third party interferes with the bailed goods. While important for resolving disputes, it's a more straightforward rule compared to the core duties and rights between the bailor and bailee.

---

This topic deals with the rights of the bailor and bailee in a situation where a **third party** wrongfully damages the goods or deprives them of their use. The rules are laid out in **Sections 180 and 181 of the Contract Act, 1872**.

#### **Who Can Sue?**

The law gives both the **bailor** and the **bailee** the right to file a lawsuit against a third-party wrongdoer.

- **Rationale**:
    
    - The **bailor** can sue because they are the ultimate owner of the goods.
        
    - The **bailee** can sue because they have the right of possession and are responsible for the goods.
        

This provides a convenient and effective way to seek a remedy without having to involve both parties in the lawsuit.

**Example**: A gives his car to B for repair. C, a stranger, negligently crashes into the car and damages it while it is parked at B's garage. Both A (the owner) and B (the possessor) have the right to sue C for the damages.

#### **Apportionment of Relief**

Whatever is obtained from the lawsuit (either the goods themselves or monetary compensation) must be divided between the bailor and the bailee according to their respective interests.

- **Example (continued)**: B, the bailee, sues C and recovers BDT 50,000 in compensation. B's repair charges were BDT 5,000. B is entitled to keep BDT 5,000 to cover his interest (his repair bill) and must hand over the remaining BDT 45,000 to A, the bailor.
