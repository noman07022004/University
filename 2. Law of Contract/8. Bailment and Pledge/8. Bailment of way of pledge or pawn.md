### **8.8 Bailment of way of pledge or pawn** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: A pledge is the legal foundation for securing loans using movable goods, from a simple transaction at a pawn shop to complex commercial financing. It is an extremely important type of bailment that creates powerful rights for the lender (pawnee) in case of default.

A **pledge**, also known as a **pawn**, is a special kind of bailment where goods are delivered as **security for the payment of a debt** or the performance of a promise.

The definition is given in **Section 172 of the Contract Act, 1872**.
