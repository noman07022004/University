Of course. Let's cover the next subtopic.

### **8.3 Types** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Why Important**: Classifying bailments is important because the type of bailment can affect the specific duties of the parties, particularly the standard of care required of the bailee. The distinction between a paid bailment and a free one is a key factor in determining liability.

Bailments can be classified in two main ways:

---

#### **1. Classification based on Reward**

This is the most common classification.

- **Gratuitous Bailment**: This is a bailment where no payment or reward is involved. It is done for free, as a favor.
    
    - **Example**: Lending your book to a friend to read, or agreeing to look after your neighbor's pet for a weekend without charge. üê∂
        
- **Non-Gratuitous Bailment (or Bailment for Reward)**: This is a bailment where one of the parties receives payment or some form of consideration. Most commercial bailments fall into this category.
    
    - **Example**: Giving your car to a mechanic for repair (you pay for the service), or hiring a car from a rental company (they receive payment for the use). üöó

#### **2. Classification based on Benefit**

This classification focuses on which party benefits from the arrangement.

- **Bailment for the Exclusive Benefit of the Bailor**: The arrangement is solely for the bailor's advantage.
    
    - **Example**: You ask your friend to look after your valuable documents while you are on vacation, without any payment. This is a type of **gratuitous bailment**.
        
- **Bailment for the Exclusive Benefit of the Bailee**: The arrangement is solely for the bailee's advantage.
    
    - **Example**: You borrow your friend's bicycle to run an errand. This is also a type of **gratuitous bailment**.
        
- **Bailment for the Mutual Benefit of Both Parties**: Both the bailor and the bailee receive a benefit from the contract. All **non-gratuitous bailments** fall into this category.
    
    - **Example**: When you give your watch for repair, the bailor (you) benefits from the repair service, and the bailee (the watchmaker) benefits from the payment.
