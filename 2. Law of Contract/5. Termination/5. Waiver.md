## 📑 **5.5 Waiver**

---

### ✅ **Introduction**

A **waiver** means **voluntarily giving up a legal right or claim** under a contract.  
It is a **one-sided act** — the promisee **chooses** not to enforce a part or all of their right.

**Example:**  
If B owes A Tk. 10,000 but A says, “Forget it, you don’t have to pay,” → A has **waived** the right to claim the debt.

### ✅ **Legal Basis**

✔ In Indian law, waiver is linked to **Sec. 63** of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.

**Section 63:**  
The promisee may:

- **Remit performance** wholly or partly (Remission)
    
- **Extend the time for performance**
    
- **Accept any other satisfaction**
    

Waiver is an aspect of **remission** — but broader because it includes giving up any contractual right.

### ✅ **Nature of Waiver**

✔ **Voluntary:** It is the promisee’s choice — not forced.  
✔ **Irrevocable:** Once waived, the right cannot be revived.  
✔ **No consideration needed:** Unlike English law, under Indian law **no fresh consideration** is required to make a waiver valid.

### ✅ **Examples**

1️⃣ **Complete Waiver:**  
A landlord waives rent for 2 months due to floods. The tenant does not have to pay for those months.

2️⃣ **Partial Waiver:**  
A supplier owes penalty for late delivery. The buyer waives half the penalty amount.

3️⃣ **Implied Waiver:**  
A party accepts late performance without protest → this may amount to waiver of the right to strict performance on time.

### ✅ **Waiver vs Remission**

- **Waiver:** Broader — any right can be given up.
    
- **Remission:** Specifically means accepting less performance.

### ✅ **Limits on Waiver**

### ✅ **Relevant Case**

**Ramanlal v. Ghanshyamdas (1942)**
