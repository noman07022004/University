### 📌 5.5 Waiver ⭐⭐

>**Why Not as Critical**: Waiver is a relatively straightforward concept compared to the more structurally complex methods of discharge like novation or frustration. It refers to the voluntary abandonment of a right, and while legally significant, it involves less detailed statutory rules than other topics.

A **waiver** is the intentional and voluntary abandonment of a known right under a contract. When a party is entitled to a certain performance or has a specific right, they can choose to "waive" it, meaning they agree not to enforce it.

The party who waives a right is released from their entitlement, and the other party is discharged from their obligation to perform that specific duty.

**How it Works** A waiver can be either express or implied:

- **Express Waiver**: A clear, explicit statement by a party that they will not demand the performance of a certain promise. For example, if a contract requires delivery by September 15th, the buyer might tell the seller, "It's okay, you can deliver it by the 20th." The buyer has waived their right to delivery on the 15th.
    
- **Implied Waiver**: A party's conduct can show that they have abandoned their right. For instance, if a landlord consistently accepts rent a week late without any objection, their conduct may imply a waiver of the right to demand payment strictly on the due date.
    

**Legal Basis** The concept of waiver is supported by **Section 63 of the Contract Act, 1872**, which allows a promisee to "dispense with... the performance of the promise made to him." This gives legal force to a waiver even if the waiving party receives no new consideration for giving up their right.

**Example** A contract requires a builder to use a specific brand of imported paint. The client visits the site, sees the builder using a different high-quality brand, and says, "No problem, I'm happy with this brand." The client has **waived** their right to insist on the specific imported paint brand and cannot later sue for breach of that term.
