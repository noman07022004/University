## 📑 **5.11 Breach of Contract**

---

### ✅ **Introduction**

A **breach of contract** means **one party fails to perform their promise** or refuses to perform it **according to the terms** of the contract.

When this happens, the contract is **discharged**, and the non-breaching party gets a **right to claim damages or other remedies**.

---

### ✅ **Types of Breach**

There are **two main types**:

---

### 1️⃣ **Actual Breach**

Occurs **when a party fails to perform on the due date** or during performance.

**Examples:**

- **On due date:** A agrees to deliver 100 bags of cement on 1st June but does not deliver → actual breach.
    
- **During performance:** A starts building a house for B but abandons the work halfway → actual breach.
    

---

### 2️⃣ **Anticipatory Breach**

Occurs when **before the due date**, one party **clearly refuses** or **makes it impossible** to perform.

**Examples:**

- A agrees to deliver goods to B on 1st July. On 1st June, A says, _“I will not deliver”_ → anticipatory breach.
    
- A promises to sell his car to B next month. Before the date, he sells it to C → anticipatory breach.

### ✅ **Legal Effect**

✔ In both cases, the innocent party can:

- **Treat the contract as ended** (discharged by breach).
    
- **Sue for damages**.
    
- Or, in anticipatory breach, **wait till due date** or sue immediately.

### ✅ **Relevant Sections**

- **Section 39**, Indian Contract Act: If a party refuses to perform or disables himself → the promisee may end the contract.
    

---

### ✅ **Important Cases**

🔹 **Hochster v De La Tour (1853)** — Leading anticipatory breach case.  
A tour guide was hired for June. In May, employer cancelled. Held: guide could sue immediately.

🔹 **Frost v Knight (1872)** — Same principle: promise broken before due date → immediate action allowed.

---

### ✅ **Remedies for Breach**

✔ **Suit for Damages** — monetary compensation.  
✔ **Suit for Specific Performance** — compel actual performance (in some cases).  
✔ **Injunction** — to stop wrongful acts.  
✔ **Quantum Meruit** — reasonable payment for work done before breach.

_(Full remedies come under Section B — you’ll study those in detail later!)_
