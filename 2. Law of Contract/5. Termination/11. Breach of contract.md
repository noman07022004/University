### üìå 5.11 Breach of contract ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: Breach is the most common reason for contract disputes and litigation. It is the wrongful failure to perform a contractual promise, which triggers the right to legal remedies like damages and, in serious cases, termination. Understanding what constitutes a breach and the different forms it can take is essential for analyzing any scenario where a contract has gone wrong.

A **breach of contract** occurs when a party, without lawful excuse, fails or refuses to perform what is due from them under the contract, performs defectively, or incapacitates themselves from performing.

A breach always gives the innocent party the right to claim **damages**. A serious breach also gives them the option to treat the contract as terminated.

#### üü° Types of Breach

##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Actual Breach 
This is the most straightforward type of breach. It occurs when a party fails to perform their obligations **on the due date** of performance.

- **Example**: A contracts to deliver goods to B on September 8th. If A fails to deliver the goods on that day, it is an actual breach.
    
- **Defective Performance**: An actual breach also occurs if a party performs, but not in accordance with the contract. For instance, delivering goods of an inferior quality or a lesser quantity than what was agreed.
    

##### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Anticipatory Breach 
This is a more complex type of breach. An anticipatory breach occurs when a party demonstrates, **before the performance is due**, a clear intention not to perform their contractual obligations. This is also known as repudiation. It can happen in two ways:

- **Express Repudiation**: The party explicitly states that they will not perform. For example, a seller sending an email a month before the delivery date stating, "I will not be supplying the goods as agreed."
    
- **Implied Repudiation**: The party does some act that makes the performance of the contract impossible. For example, A promises to sell a specific, unique painting to B on October 1st. On September 15th, B learns that A has already sold and delivered that painting to C. A's actions have made his performance impossible, implying a repudiation.

#### üü° Options for the Innocent Party in an Anticipatory Breach

When an anticipatory breach occurs, the innocent party has two choices:

##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Accept the Breach and Sue Immediately: 
They can treat the contract as immediately terminated and bring a lawsuit for damages right away, without having to wait for the original performance date. This is the principle from the landmark case **_Hochester v De La Tour (1853)_**.
    
##### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Reject the Breach and Keep the Contract Alive: 
They can choose to ignore the repudiation, affirm the contract, and wait for the performance date to arrive. This is risky because the contract remains alive for the benefit of both parties. The breaching party might change their mind and perform. However, if a frustrating event occurs in the meantime, the contract will be discharged by frustration, and the innocent party will lose their right to sue for damages.
