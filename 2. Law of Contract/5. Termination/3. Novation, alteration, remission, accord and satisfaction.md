## 📑 **5.3 Novation, Alteration, Remission, Accord & Satisfaction**

---

### ✅ **Introduction**

These are **special ways** to discharge a contract **by mutual agreement**.  
They help parties **adjust or replace obligations** without going to court.

They come under **Sections 62 and 63** of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.

---

### ✅ **1️⃣ Novation (Sec. 62)**

**Meaning:** Substituting a new contract **in place of an old one**, with consent of all parties.

**Types:**

- **Change in parties:** New party replaces old party.
    
- **Change in terms:** Same parties but new terms.
    

**Example:**  
A owes B Tk. 10,000. A, B, and C agree that C will pay B. Old contract ends → new contract formed → this is **novation**.

**Law Point:**  
✔ Old contract ends **only if** the new contract is valid and enforceable.

---

### ✅ **2️⃣ Alteration (Sec. 62)**

**Meaning:** Parties **change** one or more terms of the contract, but the parties remain the same.

**Example:**  
A contracts to deliver 500 bricks to B. They later agree to increase it to 800 bricks. This **alteration** replaces the old obligation.

**Law Point:**  
✔ The change must be with consent.  
✔ The original contract stands modified, not cancelled.

---

### ✅ **3️⃣ Rescission (Sec. 62)**

**Meaning:** Cancelling the contract **before performance**, by mutual consent.

**Example:**  
A agrees to lease land to B for 5 years. Before it starts, both agree to cancel. The contract is **rescinded**.

---

### ✅ **4️⃣ Remission (Sec. 63)**

**Meaning:** Promisee accepts **less than what was due**.

**Example:**  
A owes B Tk. 50,000. B says, “Pay me Tk. 40,000 and forget the rest.” If A pays Tk. 40,000 → B cannot claim the balance → this is **remission**.

**Law Point:**  
✔ No new consideration needed for remission — unique to Indian law.

---

### ✅ **5️⃣ Accord and Satisfaction**

This is more of an **English law principle**, but connected here.

**Meaning:**

- **Accord:** New agreement to accept something different.
    
- **Satisfaction:** Fulfillment of that new agreement.
    

**Example:**  
A owes B Tk. 20,000. They agree (accord) that instead, A will deliver a bike worth Tk. 20,000. A delivers the bike (satisfaction). Debt ends.

**Key Point:**  
✔ Accord **without satisfaction** is not enough — both are needed.
