### üìå 5.3 Novation, alteration, remission, accord and satisfaction ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: This topic provides the precise legal vocabulary for the different ways parties can mutually agree to change or end their contractual obligations. Knowing the exact difference between these terms is essential for legal accuracy when analyzing how a contract has been discharged by a subsequent agreement.

These terms represent the specific legal mechanisms through which a contract can be discharged by the creation of a new agreement or the acceptance of a different performance. The first three are explicitly covered in the Contract Act, 1872.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Novation (Section 62)

**Novation** means substituting an existing contract with a new one. The original contract is completely extinguished and need not be performed. This requires the consent of all parties.

- **How it works**:
    
    - **Change in Terms**: The parties remain the same, but the new contract has significantly different terms.
        
    - **Change in Parties**: A new party is substituted for an original party. For example, A owes B money. By mutual agreement, A, B, and C agree that C will now be the debtor instead of A. A's original contract with B is discharged by novation.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Alteration (Section 62)

**Alteration** means modifying one or more of the terms of the existing contract by mutual consent.

- **Key Distinction from Novation**: In alteration, the original contract continues to exist, just in a modified form. The identities of the parties do not change. In novation, the original contract is entirely destroyed and replaced.
    
- **Example**: A contracts to sell B a car to be delivered in 7 days. They later mutually agree to change the delivery time to 14 days. This is an alteration of the original contract.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Remission (Section 63)

**Remission** is the acceptance of a lesser fulfillment of a promise. The party entitled to performance agrees to accept less than what is due under the contract.

- **Forms of Remission**:
    
    - Accepting a lesser sum of money (e.g., accepting BDT 5,000 in full satisfaction of a BDT 8,000 debt).
        
    - Extending the time for performance.
        
    - Accepting something different in place of the original promise.
        
- **Key Feature**: Under the Contract Act, 1872, a promise to remit does **not** require fresh consideration to be legally binding.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Accord and Satisfaction (Common Law Concept)

This is the English common law equivalent for discharging a contract by a new agreement, typically after a breach has occurred. While the Contract Act has its own rules, this terminology is widely understood.

- **Accord**: This is the _agreement_ to accept a different performance in place of the original obligation. For example, after A breaches a contract, B agrees to accept a piece of equipment instead of a cash payment for damages. This new agreement is the "accord."
    
- **Satisfaction**: This is the _performance_ of the new agreement. When A delivers the equipment to B, that is the "satisfaction."
    

The original obligation is discharged only when the satisfaction (the new performance) is complete.
