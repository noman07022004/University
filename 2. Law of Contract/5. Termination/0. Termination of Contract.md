## 📑 **Bigger Picture: Termination of Contract**

---

### ✅ **What It’s About**

**Termination of contract** means **bringing a valid contract to an end**, so that the parties are **no longer bound** by their obligations under it.

**When does it happen?**

- When the **purpose is fulfilled**, or
    
- When parties agree to end it, or
    
- By **law**, or
    
- Due to **impossibility**, or
    
- Because of a **breach**.

### ✅ **Why It Matters**

✔️ It protects parties from being stuck with impossible or unfair obligations.  
✔️ It decides **rights & liabilities** when a contract ends.  
✔️ It helps courts resolve disputes about **what happens after termination**.

### ✅ **How It Happens**

The syllabus breaks Termination down into these **subtopics**:  
1️⃣ **Methods of Termination** — various ways a contract can end.  
2️⃣ **Termination by Performance & Mutual Agreement** — natural ending or agreed exit.  
3️⃣ **Novation, Alteration, Remission, Accord & Satisfaction** — legal substitutes for performance.  
4️⃣ **Rescission** — cancellation by agreement or court.  
5️⃣ **Waiver** — party gives up rights voluntarily.  
6️⃣ **Merger** — lesser right merges into greater right.  
7️⃣ **Supervening Impossibility** — something happens making performance impossible.  
8️⃣ **Doctrine of Frustration** — contract automatically ends due to impossibility.  
9️⃣ **Operation of Law** — e.g., death, insolvency.  
🔟 **Lapse of Time** — contract ends if not enforced in time.  
1️⃣1️⃣ **Breach of Contract** — one party fails to perform → other can treat it as ended.

### ✅ **What You’ll Gain**

By the end of this section, you should know:  
✔️ **When** and **how** a contract ends.
