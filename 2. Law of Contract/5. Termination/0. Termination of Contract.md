## üìå 5. Termination of Contract ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: This topic is as critical as "Formation of Contract." Knowing how a contract is lawfully brought to an end is fundamental to the entire subject. It explains the various ways contractual obligations are extinguished, from successful completion (performance) to breakdown (breach) and unforeseen events (frustration). This area is a major source of legal disputes and examination questions.

Termination of a contract, also known as **discharge of contract**, refers to the process by which the contractual relationship between the parties comes to an end. Once a contract is discharged, the parties are released from their obligations. A contract can be terminated in several ways.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Termination by Performance and Mutual Agreement

The most natural and desirable way to terminate a contract is by **performance**, where both parties fulfill their promises completely and precisely. The contract is then said to be discharged.

Alternatively, just as a contract is created by agreement, it can be terminated by **mutual agreement**. Parties are free to release each other from their obligations. This can take several forms:

- **Novation, Alteration, Remission (Section 62 & 63)**: As discussed previously, parties can agree to substitute a new contract (**novation**), change the terms of the existing one (**alteration**), or accept a lesser fulfillment of the promise (**remission**).
    
- **Rescission**: Parties can mutually agree to cancel the contract.
    
- **Waiver**: A party can voluntarily abandon their rights under the contract.
    
- **Accord and Satisfaction**: This is a common law concept where one party, having breached the contract, offers some new consideration ("satisfaction") which the other party accepts ("accord") in place of their original claim.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Termination by Impossibility of Performance (Frustration)

Sometimes, after a contract is formed, an unforeseen event occurs that makes performance impossible or radically different from what was originally intended. This is known as **supervening impossibility**, and it discharges the contract. The legal principle governing this is the **Doctrine of Frustration** (covered in Section 56 of the Contract Act).

For the doctrine to apply, the event must:

- Occur _after_ the contract was formed.
    
- Be beyond the control of either party.
    
- Render the performance of the contract physically or commercially impossible.
    

**Examples of frustration include**: destruction of the subject matter (a specific concert hall burning down), death or incapacity in a personal contract, or a change in the law making performance illegal. If the contract is frustrated, it becomes void, and the parties are discharged from performing.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Termination by Operation of Law

A contract can be terminated automatically by the operation of law in certain circumstances, independent of the parties' wishes. This includes:

- **Death**: In contracts involving personal skill.
    
- **Insolvency**: An insolvent person is discharged from liabilities on their contracts.
    
- **Merger**: When an inferior right under a contract merges into a superior right. For example, a person who is a tenant on a property later buys that property. Their right as a tenant (inferior) merges into their right as an owner (superior), and the tenancy contract is discharged.
    
- **Lapse of Time**: A contract can be terminated if it is not performed or enforced within the period specified by the Limitation Act. The remedy is barred by law, effectively discharging the contract.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Termination by Breach of Contract

A **breach of contract** occurs when a party fails or refuses to perform their contractual obligation without a lawful excuse. This is the most common cause of contract litigation. A breach gives the innocent party the right to claim damages. If the breach is serious enough (a breach of a fundamental term or condition), it also gives the innocent party the right to treat the contract as terminated.

A breach can be:

- **Actual Breach**: A failure to perform when performance is due.
    
- **Anticipatory Breach**: When a party declares their intention not to perform _before_ the date of performance has arrived. The innocent party can either sue immediately or wait for the due date to pass.
