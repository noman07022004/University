### üìå 5.7 Supervening impossibility ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: This doctrine is a crucial exception to the general rule that parties must fulfill their contractual promises. It addresses what happens when unforeseen, external events make performance impossible after the contract has been formed. It is a major area of contract law that provides a legal basis for excusing parties from their obligations, and it is frequently tested.

**Supervening impossibility** occurs when a contract, which was valid and possible to perform when it was made, becomes impossible to perform at a later stage due to a subsequent event. This is distinct from "initial impossibility," where an agreement is void from the start because it was to do an act that was already impossible.

The governing law is **Section 56 (paragraph 2) of the Contract Act, 1872**, which states:

> _"A contract to do an act which, after the contract is made, becomes impossible, or, by reason of some event which the promisor could not prevent, unlawful, becomes void when the act becomes impossible or unlawful."_

**Legal Effect**: When supervening impossibility occurs, the contract becomes **void**, and both parties are discharged from their obligations to perform.

#### üü° Grounds for Supervening Impossibility

The courts have recognized several situations where a contract is discharged on this ground:

##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Destruction of the Subject Matter 
If the specific subject matter essential to the performance of the contract is destroyed without the fault of either party, the contract is discharged.

- **Landmark Case**: In **_Taylor v Caldwell (1863)_**, a contract was made to hire a music hall for a series of concerts. Before the first concert, the hall accidentally burned down. The court held that the contract was discharged. The continued existence of the hall was an implied condition for the fulfillment of the contract. üî•
    

##### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Death or Personal Incapacity 
In contracts that depend on the personal skill or qualification of a specific person (like contracts for artistic performance, surgery, or writing), the death or incapacitating illness of that person will discharge the contract.

- **Example**: A renowned pianist is contracted to perform at a concert. He suffers a severe hand injury before the performance, making it impossible for him to play. The contract is discharged.
    

##### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Change in Law (Subsequent Illegality) 
If a change in the law or government policy makes the performance of the contract illegal, the contract is discharged.

- **Example**: A company in Bangladesh contracts to export specific goods to Country X. Before the shipment, the Government of Bangladesh passes a law banning the export of those goods. The performance has become unlawful, so the contract is discharged. üìú
    

##### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Non-occurrence of a Contemplated Event 
If a contract is entered into on the basis of a specific event happening, and that event forms the very foundation of the contract, the non-occurrence of the event will discharge the contract.

- **Landmark Case**: In **_Krell v Henry (1903)_** (one of the "coronation cases"), a room was hired for the specific purpose of viewing the coronation procession of King Edward VII. The procession was cancelled because the King fell ill. The court held that the contract was discharged. The procession was the foundation of the contract, and its cancellation made the purpose of the contract impossible to achieve.

#### üü° When the Doctrine Does Not Apply

The doctrine of impossibility is not a tool to escape a bad bargain. It does not apply in cases of:

- **Commercial Hardship**: A contract simply becoming more expensive or less profitable to perform is not a ground for impossibility.
    
- **Self-Induced Impossibility**: A party cannot cause the impossibility themselves and then claim discharge.
    
- **Strikes or Lockouts**: These are generally considered temporary and do not make the contract permanently impossible to perform.
