## 📑 **5.7 Supervening Impossibility**

---

### ✅ **Introduction**

**Supervening impossibility** means that **after a valid contract is made**, an **unforeseen event** occurs which makes **performance impossible or unlawful**.  
When this happens, the contract becomes **void**.

In Indian law, this concept is closely linked with the **Doctrine of Frustration** (**Sec. 56, Indian Contract Act, 1872**).

---

### ✅ **Relevant Law**

**Section 56:**  
1️⃣ An agreement to do an impossible act is void.  
2️⃣ If an act becomes impossible or unlawful **after the contract is made**, **without the fault of the promisor**, the contract becomes void.

---

### ✅ **Key Points**

✔ The impossibility must be **beyond the control** of the parties.  
✔ Mere **difficulty or expense** is not enough — it must be truly impossible or illegal.  
✔ The doctrine **excuses performance** and ends the contract.

### ✅ **When Does Supervening Impossibility Apply?**

**Common examples:**

1️⃣ **Destruction of subject matter:**  
A contracts to sell a specific ship. Before delivery, the ship sinks → performance impossible.

2️⃣ **Change of law:**  
A contracts to export goods to another country. Government bans export → performance unlawful.

3️⃣ **Death/Incapacity (personal contracts):**  
A contracts to paint a portrait. A dies → impossible to perform personally.

4️⃣ **Non-happening of an essential event:**  
A rents hall for a coronation ceremony. The coronation is cancelled → purpose frustrated.

---

### ✅ **When Supervening Impossibility does NOT apply**

✔ If performance only becomes more **burdensome, expensive, or less profitable**, the doctrine does not apply.

✔ **Self-induced impossibility:** If a party creates the impossibility by their own act, they cannot claim frustration.

### ✅ **Key Cases**

🔹 **Taylor v Caldwell (1863)**  
Concert hall hired for a show was destroyed by fire → contract frustrated → parties discharged.

🔹 **Satyabrata Ghose v Mugneeram Bangur & Co. (1954)** — India  
Land was requisitioned by the government → building project became impossible → contract frustrated.

🔹 **Tsakiroglou v Noblee Thorl GmbH (1962)**  
Closure of Suez Canal made shipping longer but not impossible → contract **not frustrated** — just more expensive.

### ✅ **Effect of Supervening Impossibility**

✔ Contract becomes **void** automatically — no need for court declaration.

✔ **Benefits received must be restored** under **Sec. 65**.
