### üìå 5.8 Doctrine of frustration ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: This is the formal legal name for the principle of termination by supervening impossibility. Understanding the "doctrine" involves not just knowing the rule, but also appreciating its theoretical foundation and its consequences. It is a major legal concept that provides a just and equitable solution when a contract's entire purpose is destroyed by unforeseen events.

The **Doctrine of Frustration** is the legal principle by which a contract is automatically discharged when a supervening event, occurring after the contract was made and without the fault of either party, renders performance of the contract impossible, illegal, or radically different from what was contemplated by the parties.

While the previous subtopic looked at the specific grounds of impossibility, this topic looks at the theory itself and its legal effects. In the context of the **Contract Act, 1872**, this doctrine is primarily embodied in **Section 56**.

#### üü° The Theoretical Basis

The doctrine evolved to soften the old, harsh common law rule that contractual obligations were absolute. Early courts did not excuse a party from performance, even if it became impossible. The modern doctrine is justified on the basis that:

- **A Radical Change in the Obligation**: The modern view is that the court is giving effect to the true basis of the contract. If the supervening event has so fundamentally changed the circumstances that the performance would be a "radical change in the obligation," it would be unjust to hold the parties to their original bargain. The foundation upon which the contract was built has disappeared.

#### üü° Consequences of Frustration

When a contract is frustrated, the legal consequences are automatic and immediate:

##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ The Contract Becomes Void 
The contract is terminated automatically at the moment the frustrating event occurs. It is not cancelled by the choice of the parties; the law terminates it.

##### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Future Obligations are Discharged 
From the moment of frustration, both parties are released from any further obligations to perform. The contract is over.

##### 3Ô∏è‚É£ The Rule of Restitution (Section 65) 
What happens to payments already made or benefits already conferred before the frustration? The common law rule was harsh ("the loss lies where it falls"). However, the **Contract Act, 1872**, provides a much fairer solution in **Section 65**.

**Section 65** states that when a contract becomes void, any person who has received any **advantage** under that contract is bound to **restore it**, or to make compensation for it, to the person from whom they received it.

- **Example**: A pays B an advance of BDT 100,000 for a shipment of imported goods. Before the goods can be shipped, the government bans their import (frustrating event). The contract becomes void. Under Section 65, B must return the BDT 100,000 advance to A. üí∞
    

The Doctrine of Frustration is therefore a vital legal tool. It doesn't exist to let parties escape a bad deal, but to recognize that when an external event shatters the very foundation of the contract, the only just solution is to discharge both parties from their obligations.
