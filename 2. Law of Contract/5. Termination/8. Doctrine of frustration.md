## 📑 **5.8 Doctrine of Frustration**

---

### ✅ **Introduction**

The **Doctrine of Frustration** is a **fundamental principle** in contract law.  
It means: **When an unforeseen event occurs after a valid contract is made, which destroys the very purpose of the contract or makes performance impossible or unlawful, the contract automatically comes to an end.**

✔ **Legal Basis:**  
**Section 56, Indian Contract Act, 1872** — second paragraph.

It is really an **extension** of **supervening impossibility**, but not limited to physical impossibility — it covers when the **main purpose** of the contract fails too.

---

### ✅ **Key Idea**

A contract **depends on the existence of a certain situation or state of things**. If that situation disappears, the foundation is destroyed — the contract is **frustrated**.

---

### ✅ **When Doctrine of Frustration applies**

🔑 The contract is frustrated when:

1️⃣ **Physical impossibility:**  
E.g., subject matter destroyed — _Taylor v Caldwell_ (the theatre burnt down).

2️⃣ **Legal impossibility:**  
Change in law — e.g., export banned.

3️⃣ **Failure of fundamental purpose:**  
The performance is possible, but the main purpose is defeated.

**Example:**

- Krell v Henry (1903):*  
    Room rented to watch King Edward VII’s coronation procession → coronation cancelled → purpose frustrated → contract ended.

### ✅ **Requirements for Frustration**

✔ The event must be **unforeseen**.  
✔ Neither party must be **responsible** for the event.  
✔ The event must make performance **impossible or radically different**.

---

### ✅ **When Frustration does NOT apply**

❌ If the event is **foreseeable** or should have been provided for in the contract.

❌ If performance only becomes **more difficult or expensive** (not impossible).

❌ If the impossibility is **self-induced** by one party.

### ✅ **Important Indian Case**

**Satyabrata Ghose v Mugneeram Bangur & Co. (1954)**  
Supreme Court confirmed the doctrine in India: Requisition of land made the building project impossible → contract frustrated.

**Key point:** The court looks at **practical impossibility**, not just literal.

---

### ✅ **Effect of Frustration**

✔ The contract becomes **void** under **Sec. 56**.  
✔ Any benefit received must be **restored** under **Sec. 65**.

### ✅ **Difference: Frustration vs Force Majeure**

|**Doctrine of Frustration**|**Force Majeure Clause**|
|---|---|
|Implied by law (Sec. 56)|Express clause agreed by parties|
|Unforeseen event makes contract void|Specific events allow suspension/extension|
|Court decides if frustration applies|Parties follow agreed terms|
