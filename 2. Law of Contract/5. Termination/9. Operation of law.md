### 5.9 Operation of law ⭐⭐

>**Why Not as Critical**: This is a category that groups several distinct and often less common methods of discharge. While legally important for completeness, individual grounds like insolvency or merger are more specialized and less frequently tested in a general contract law exam compared to the major topics of breach and frustration.

---

A contract can be terminated automatically by the application of a legal rule, regardless of the parties' intentions. This is known as **discharge by operation of law**. The law itself intervenes and brings the contract to an end when certain events occur.

The main instances of discharge by operation of law are:

#### 1️⃣ Death 
The death of a promisor discharges a contract if it involves their **personal skill or qualification**. The obligation cannot be fulfilled by their legal heirs.

- **Example**: A contract for a famous singer to perform at an event is terminated upon her death. However, a contract to sell a car is _not_ terminated by death; the seller's legal heirs are bound to complete the sale.
    

#### 2️⃣ Insolvency 
When a person is declared insolvent by a court, their rights and obligations under most contracts are vested in a court-appointed official. The insolvent person is discharged from their pre-insolvency contractual liabilities, effectively terminating those contracts as far as their personal obligation is concerned.

#### 3️⃣ Merger 
As discussed previously, a contract is discharged by merger when an inferior right held by a person merges into a superior right that the same person later acquires.

- **Example**: A tenant who later buys the property they were renting. The lease contract (inferior right) is terminated as it merges into the right of ownership (superior right).
    

#### 4️⃣ Unauthorized Material Alteration 
If one party makes a significant (**material**) alteration to a written contract without the consent of the other party, the innocent party can choose to treat the contract as discharged.

- **What is a material alteration?** A change that affects the legal character of the contract, such as changing the amount, interest rate, or names of the parties.
    
- **Example**: B alters a cheque for BDT 5,000 given by A to read BDT 50,000. This is a material alteration that can void the instrument.
