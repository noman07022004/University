## 📑 **5.9 Operation of Law**

---

### ✅ **Introduction**

**Operation of Law** means that a contract can **automatically come to an end** or get discharged **by the effect of law**, **without any action by the parties**.

In simple words — certain legal events **cancel or discharge the contract**, whether or not the parties agree.

---

### ✅ **When Contracts End by Operation of Law**

Here are **common situations**:

---

### 1️⃣ **Death (in personal contracts)**

- If a contract depends on the **personal skill or ability** of a party, their death discharges it.  
    **Example:** A famous singer contracts to perform. If the singer dies → contract ends.
    
- But if the contract **does not require personal performance**, the legal representatives must perform it.  
    **Example:** Loan repayment → heirs must pay.
    

---

### 2️⃣ **Insolvency or Bankruptcy**

- When a party is declared **insolvent**, their assets are taken over by an Official Receiver.
    
- Unperformed contracts are either discharged or handled by the Receiver.  
    **Example:** A businessman who owes money becomes bankrupt — pending supply contracts may be discharged.
    

---

### 3️⃣ **Merger** (already covered)

- A lower right merges into a higher right in the same person → contract ends automatically.
    

---

### 4️⃣ **Unauthorized Alteration**

- If one party **fraudulently changes the terms** of a written contract **without the consent** of the other → contract is void.  
    **Example:** A changes the amount in a promissory note from Tk. 1,000 to Tk. 10,000 → entire contract void.
    

---

### 5️⃣ **Rights Merged by Court Order**

- Sometimes, a contract right merges into a **judgment decree**. Once a court gives a decree, the original contract right merges into that decree → the contract ends.

### ✅ **Important Points**

✔ **Operation of Law** applies **automatically** — no new agreement is needed.  
✔ The parties may have no choice — it happens by force of law.  
✔ It protects fairness — e.g., prevents enforcing a contract when a person is dead or bankrupt.

---

### ✅ **Relevant Case Example**

**N.D. Hill & Co. v Ryott (1912)**  
A materially altered a cheque without B’s consent → held: alteration discharged the instrument by operation of law.
