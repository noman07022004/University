## 📑 **5.1 Methods of Termination of Contract**

---

### ✅ **Introduction**

Contracts do not last forever. They **terminate** — either naturally or by legal reasons.  
Termination means the parties are **released from their contractual obligations**.

The **main methods** of termination are:  
1️⃣ By performance,  
2️⃣ By mutual agreement,  
3️⃣ By impossibility or frustration,  
4️⃣ By operation of law,  
5️⃣ By lapse of time,  
6️⃣ By breach of contract.

These are supported by **Sections 37, 62–67**, and **Section 56** of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.

### ✅ **1️⃣ Termination by Performance**

✔ When both parties fully perform their promises, the contract ends naturally.

**Example:**  
A contracts to sell a car to B for Tk. 5,00,000. A delivers the car, B pays. Contract over by **performance**.

---

### ✅ **2️⃣ Termination by Mutual Agreement**

✔ Parties can agree to end or modify the contract:

- **Novation (Sec. 62):** Replace old contract with new.
    
- **Rescission (Sec. 62):** Cancel by consent.
    
- **Alteration (Sec. 62):** Change terms by consent.
    

**Example:**  
A owes B Tk. 50,000. They agree that A will deliver goods worth Tk. 50,000 instead. Old debt ends — contract terminates by **novation**.

---

### ✅ **3️⃣ Termination by Impossibility or Frustration**

✔ When performance becomes **impossible** due to an event beyond control, the contract ends.

This is the **Doctrine of Frustration (Sec. 56).**

**Example:**  
A contracts to paint B’s house. Before work starts, the house burns down. Performance is impossible → contract ends.

---

### ✅ **4️⃣ Termination by Operation of Law**

✔ A contract may terminate automatically by law:

- **Death** (in personal service contracts),
    
- **Insolvency**,
    
- **Merger of rights**.
    

**Example:**  
A hires B as his personal lawyer. If B dies, contract ends by **operation of law**.

---

### ✅ **5️⃣ Termination by Lapse of Time**

✔ If a party does not enforce rights within **limitation period**, the contract ends.

**Example:**  
A fails to sue B for payment within 3 years → debt becomes time-barred.

---

### ✅ **6️⃣ Termination by Breach of Contract**

✔ If one party **refuses** to perform or **does not perform properly**, the other can treat the contract as ended and claim damages.

**Example:**  
A contracts to supply B with goods on 1st July. A fails to deliver. B can terminate and sue for damages.
