### üìå 5.1 Methods of termination ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: This topic serves as a crucial roadmap for the entire subject of contract discharge. It categorizes the various ways a contract's life can end. Understanding this framework is essential for structuring your analysis of any contract termination problem and for navigating the more detailed subtopics that follow.

The termination or **discharge** of a contract refers to the end of the contractual obligations that bind the parties. Once a contract is discharged, the parties are freed from their duty to perform. The primary methods by which a contract can be terminated are:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ By Performance 
This is the most common and ideal method. When both parties fulfill their respective promises completely and accurately, the contract's purpose is achieved, and it is discharged.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ By Mutual Agreement or Consent 
Just as a contract is formed by agreement, it can be terminated by agreement. This includes:

- **Novation**: Replacing the original contract with a new one.
    
- **Rescission**: Mutually agreeing to cancel the contract.
    
- **Alteration**: Mutually agreeing to change the terms of the contract.
    
- **Remission**: Acceptance of a lesser performance.
    

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ By Impossibility of Performance (Frustration) 
If, after the contract is made, performance becomes impossible due to an unforeseen event beyond the parties' control (e.g., destruction of the subject matter, change in law), the contract is discharged. This is known as the **doctrine of frustration**.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ By Lapse of Time 
If a contract is not performed or enforced within a specific period as prescribed by the Limitation Act, the remedy is barred by law. The contract is effectively terminated because it can no longer be legally enforced. ‚è≥

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ By Operation of Law 
A contract can be discharged by the law in certain circumstances, such as:

- **Death**: In contracts requiring personal skill.
    
- **Insolvency**: The insolvent party is discharged from their pre-existing contractual liabilities.
    
- **Merger**: An inferior right under a contract merges into a superior right.
    

#### 6Ô∏è‚É£ By Breach of Contract 
When a party fails to perform their obligation without a lawful excuse, they are said to have breached the contract. A serious breach gives the innocent party the right to treat the contract as terminated and to sue for damages. üíî
