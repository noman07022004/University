### üìå 5.4 Rescission ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: Rescission is a fundamental remedy in contract law. It is the legal mechanism for "unwinding" or cancelling a contract. It's particularly important as the primary right of a party whose consent to a contract was not freely given, making it a key concept in disputes involving misrepresentation, fraud, and other vitiating factors.

**Rescission** means to cancel a contract and restore the parties to the position they were in before the contract was made (a concept known as _restitutio in integrum_). A contract can be rescinded in two primary ways.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Rescission by Mutual Agreement

This is a straightforward method of discharge, covered under **Section 62 of the Contract Act, 1872**. The parties to a contract can simply agree to cancel it. The consideration for each party's promise to release the other is the release they receive in return.

- **Example**: A agrees to supply goods to B. Before the delivery date, market conditions change, and both parties decide it is better not to proceed. They mutually agree to cancel the contract. The contract is discharged by rescission.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Unilateral Rescission as a Right

This is the more common legal meaning of rescission. It is the right of one party to cancel a contract without the other's consent. This right arises when a contract is **voidable**.

A contract becomes voidable at the option of the innocent party in several situations, including:

- When consent was caused by **coercion, undue influence, fraud, or misrepresentation** (Sections 19 & 19A).
    
- When one party fails to perform their promise at the agreed time, and **time was of the essence** (Section 55).
    
- When one party **prevents** the other from performing their obligation (Section 53).
    

**The Effect of Rescission** When an innocent party chooses to exercise their right to rescind, two things happen:

1. The contract is set aside, and the parties are freed from their obligations.
    
2. The party rescinding the contract must **restore any benefit** they have received under it to the other party (**Section 64**). This is the principle of restitution.
    

- **Example**: A sells a car to B, fraudulently claiming it has a new engine. B pays A BDT 500,000. Upon discovering the fraud, B has the right to rescind the contract. To do so, B must return the car to A, and upon doing so, A must refund the BDT 500,000 to B. ‚Ü©Ô∏è
