## 📑 **5.4 Rescission**

---

### ✅ **Introduction**

**Rescission** means **cancellation of a contract** by mutual consent or by law.  
When a contract is rescinded, the parties are **restored to their original position** — as if the contract **never existed**.

**Relevant Section:**  
✔ **Sec. 62:** Rescission by agreement.  
✔ Also under **Sec. 39, 53, 64, 65** for other contexts.

---

### ✅ **How Rescission Happens**

There are **3 main ways**:

1️⃣ **By mutual agreement** — both parties agree to cancel.  
2️⃣ **By breach** — one party refuses to perform, the other may rescind.  
3️⃣ **By law** — when the contract becomes voidable.

---

### 🔹 **1️⃣ Rescission by Mutual Agreement (Sec. 62)**

✔ Both parties decide **not to perform**.

**Example:**  
A agrees to paint B’s house. Before starting, both agree to cancel. → Contract is rescinded.

---

### 🔹 **2️⃣ Rescission due to Breach (Sec. 39)**

✔ If one party refuses or disables themselves from performing, the other may **rescind** the contract.

**Example:**  
A hires B to deliver goods. B refuses. A can treat the contract as rescinded and sue for damages.

---

### 🔹 **3️⃣ Rescission of Voidable Contracts (Sec. 64)**

✔ If a contract is **voidable** (e.g., consent by fraud, misrepresentation, coercion), the aggrieved party can rescind it.

**Example:**  
A buys land from B due to B’s fraud. A can rescind the contract and recover any benefit transferred.

---

### ✅ **Effects of Rescission**

✔ All obligations end.  
✔ Any benefits must be restored (**Sec. 65**).

---

### ✅ **Limits on Rescission**

Rescission **cannot** be claimed if:

- The party has ratified the contract after discovering the defect.
    
- Third party rights have intervened.
    
- It’s impossible to restore the original position.
    
- Delay or lapse of time makes rescission unfair.

### ✅ **Relevant Case**

**Clarke v Dickson (1858)**  
A bought company shares by misrepresentation. He could not rescind because it was impossible to return to original position — the company had changed.
