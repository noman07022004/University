## 📑 **5.2 Termination by Performance and Mutual Agreement**

---

### ✅ **Introduction**

Two **common and lawful ways** a contract ends are:  
1️⃣ By **performance** — when both parties fulfill their promises as agreed.  
2️⃣ By **mutual agreement** — when both parties agree to **cancel**, **change**, or **replace** the contract.

Both protect the **freedom of contract** — parties are free to end what they freely made.

Relevant sections: **Section 37** (performance) & **Section 62–63** (agreement).

---

### ✅ **1️⃣ Termination by Performance**

✔ This is the **simplest way**: when parties do exactly what they promised, the contract naturally **comes to an end**.

**Example:**  
A agrees to deliver 100 bags of rice to B on 1st August. B agrees to pay Tk. 50,000. A delivers, B pays. Contract ends — both are discharged.

✔ **Partial performance:** Sometimes performance may be partial but accepted in full satisfaction.

---

### ✅ **2️⃣ Termination by Mutual Agreement**

Sometimes parties may not want to perform as planned — so they **mutually agree** to end or change the contract.  
Law allows this under **Sections 62 & 63**.

---

### 🔹 **(A) Novation — Sec. 62**

✔ **Novation** means **substituting** a new contract for an old one.

**Example:**  
A owes B Tk. 50,000. A, B, and C agree that C will pay B instead. Old debt ends — new contract begins → contract terminated by **novation**.

---

### 🔹 **(B) Rescission — Sec. 62**

✔ **Rescission** means **cancelling** the old contract by mutual consent.

**Example:**  
A agrees to sell B a house. Before sale deed is signed, both agree to cancel. Original contract ends → no obligations remain.

---

### 🔹 **(C) Alteration — Sec. 62**

✔ Parties may **alter** some terms — creating a new contract.

**Example:**  
A agrees to supply 500 chairs to B. Later, both agree to change it to 400 chairs. Original contract is **discharged** → new one takes its place.

---

### 🔹 **(D) Remission — Sec. 63**

✔ The promisee may accept **less performance** than promised.

**Example:**  
A owes B Tk. 10,000. B says, “Pay me Tk. 7,000 and I’ll treat it as full payment.” If A pays Tk. 7,000, the contract ends.

---

### ✅ **Legal Rules**

✔ Parties must **mutually agree** — one party alone cannot cancel.  
✔ Once properly rescinded/altered → old rights & duties end.  
✔ Novation requires a **valid new contract**.

---

### ✅ **Relevant Case**

**Scarf v Jardine (1882)**  
Facts: Partners changed → new partnership took over debts. Held: Old contract ended by novation.

### 📌 **Tip**

✔ When you see **Sec. 62**, think **Novation, Rescission, Alteration**.  
✔ For **Sec. 63**, think **Remission, Waiver**.  
✔ Use simple examples in answers.

### ✏️ **Key Takeaways**

✔ **Full performance** ends the contract naturally.  
✔ **Mutual agreement** can discharge a contract by:

- **Novation** (new contract),
    
- **Rescission** (cancellation),
    
- **Alteration** (change terms),
    
- **Remission** (accept less performance).  
    ✔ These uphold **freedom to contract and end contracts** by consent.
