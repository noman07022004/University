### üìå 5.2 Termination by performance and mutual agreement ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: This topic covers the two most common and straightforward ways a contract is discharged. Understanding termination by performance is key to recognizing the successful completion of a contract, while termination by mutual agreement is fundamental to the principle of party autonomy, showing how parties can willingly alter or end their legal relationships.

These methods represent the consensual and intended pathways for a contract's conclusion, either through its successful fulfillment or by a subsequent agreement to end it.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Termination by Performance

This is the most natural and desirable mode of discharging a contract. Performance means that the parties have done exactly what they promised to do under the contract. Once both parties have fulfilled their obligations, the contract's purpose is achieved, and it comes to a complete end.

- **What Constitutes Performance**: The performance must be **complete and precise**, in accordance with the terms of the contract regarding time, place, and manner.
    
- **Offer of Performance (Tender)**: As previously discussed, a contract is also discharged by performance if one party makes a valid **tender** (a ready and willing offer to perform) and the other party rejects it. The party who made the tender is discharged from their obligation.
    

When performance is complete, all rights and duties under the contract are extinguished. ‚úÖ

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Termination by Mutual Agreement

The guiding principle here is that what is created by agreement can be ended by agreement. The parties to a contract are free to mutually agree to release each other from their obligations. This is covered in **Sections 62 and 63 of the Contract Act, 1872**. The main forms are:

- **Novation**: The substitution of a new contract in place of the original one. The original contract is discharged and need not be performed. This can involve changing the terms or the parties.
    
- **Rescission**: The cancellation of the contract by mutual consent. The parties agree to "unmake" the bargain, and both are released.
    
- **Alteration**: The modification of one or more terms of the original contract. The original contract continues in its new, altered form.
    
- **Remission**: The acceptance by the promisee of a lesser performance than what was promised. For example, accepting BDT 7,000 in full settlement of a BDT 10,000 debt discharges the entire contract.
