## 📑 **5.10 Lapse of Time**

---

### ✅ **Introduction**

A contract can be **discharged by lapse of time** when the time fixed by law to **enforce the contract expires**.  
In other words:

> If a party does not take legal action within the prescribed time, they **lose the right to sue**, and the contract becomes **unenforceable**.

---

### ✅ **Legal Basis**

✔ The **Limitation Act, 1908** (or the applicable Limitation Act in Bangladesh/India) fixes time limits for filing suits.

✔ Example:

- For a **simple contract**, the limitation period is usually **3 years** from the date the performance was due.
    

---

### ✅ **Key Rule**

> **If the aggrieved party does not enforce the contract within this period, the right to sue is barred.**

👉 The contract itself **does not end**, but the **remedy is lost**. So practically, it’s as good as discharged.

---

### ✅ **Example**

🔹 A owes B Tk. 10,000. Repayment date: 1 January 2020.  
If B does not file a suit by 1 January 2023 (within 3 years), he **cannot recover** the money through court.

So, the debt **remains**, but it **cannot be enforced** → contract discharged by **lapse of time**.

---

### ✅ **Important Points**

✔ Lapse of time affects **the remedy**, not the obligation itself.  
✔ Courts will not help an inactive party.  
✔ This rule encourages parties to act promptly.

---

### ✅ **Relevant Case Example**

**Kuldip Singh v Govt. of India (1980)**  
The Supreme Court held that once the limitation period passes, the right to sue is barred, and the contract is practically discharged.
