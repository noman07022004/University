### üìå 5.10 Lapse of time ‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Not as Critical**: The core concept is straightforward‚Äîlegal rights expire if not enforced in time. However, the specific time limits and detailed rules belong to the Law of Limitation, not contract law itself. In a contract course, it's an important principle to know, but it isn't a complex contractual doctrine.

---

The law provides a specific period within which a person must enforce their legal rights. If a party fails to take legal action within this prescribed period, they lose their right to a judicial remedy. This is known as **discharge by lapse of time**.

The principle is based on the legal maxim: **_Vigilantibus non dormientibus jura subveniunt_** (The law assists the vigilant, not those who sleep on their rights).

**The Governing Law** In Bangladesh, the time limits for filing different types of lawsuits are laid down in the **Limitation Act, 1908**. For example, the period of limitation for filing a suit for breach of a simple contract is three years from the date the cause of action arises. ‚è≥

**Effect of Lapse of Time** The Limitation Act does not extinguish the contract itself; it only extinguishes the **remedy**.

- **The Right vs. The Remedy**: The contractual right (e.g., the right to a debt) continues to exist, but the ability to enforce that right in a court of law is lost. The right becomes **unenforceable**.
    
- **Practical Result**: For all practical purposes, the contract is discharged because the courts will no longer assist in its enforcement.
    

**Example**

- **Scenario**: A takes a loan from B, promising to repay it on September 1, 2022. The limitation period is three years.
    
- **Action**: A fails to pay. B does not file a lawsuit against A.
    
- **Outcome**: After September 1, 2025, B's right to sue A is barred by limitation. The contract is effectively terminated because B has lost his legal remedy. The debt is now "time-barred."
    

**Important Note**: If the debtor (A) voluntarily pays the time-barred debt after the limitation period has expired, they cannot later sue to recover the money. The payment is valid because the underlying debt (the right) still existed.
