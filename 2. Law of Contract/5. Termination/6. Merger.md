### 📌 5.6 Merger ⭐

>**Why Not as Critical**: Merger is a technical and relatively rare method of contract discharge that is more commonly associated with property law (e.g., landlord-tenant law). It is unlikely to be a major focus in a general contract law examination.

---

**Merger** is a mode of discharging a contract by operation of law. It occurs when an **inferior right** held by a person under a contract is absorbed into a **superior right** that the same person subsequently acquires.

The principle is that a person cannot hold two different levels of rights in the same subject matter simultaneously. The lesser right is "drowned" or merged into the greater right, and the contract creating the lesser right is automatically terminated.

**The Classic Example**

The easiest way to understand merger is through a landlord-tenant scenario:

- **Scenario**: A is a tenant living in a house owned by B. A has a lease agreement, which gives him the inferior right of tenancy.
    
- **Action**: A later purchases the house from B. A now holds the superior right of ownership.
    
- **Outcome**: A's right as a tenant merges into his right as the owner. He cannot be his own landlord and his own tenant. Therefore, the lease agreement is automatically discharged by merger. The obligation to pay rent is extinguished.
