## 📑 **5.6 Merger**

---

### ✅ **Introduction**

**Merger** is a **method of discharging a contract** when an **inferior right merges into a superior right** in the same person.  
The idea is: **Two rights cannot exist together if one absorbs the other.**

It is based on the **principle of unity of rights**.

---

### ✅ **What is Merger?**

✔ When a **lesser right or estate** and a **greater right or estate** come to the same person, the lesser merges into the greater and **loses independent existence**.

**Example (Property Law context):**  
A tenant (lessee) buys the leased property from the landlord (lessor). The leasehold right merges into the freehold right → the lease ends automatically.

### ✅ **Merger in Contract Law**

While **merger** is mainly a property concept, it can apply in contract law when **a lesser contractual right merges into a higher one**.

**Example:**  
A holds a mortgage on B’s land. Later, A buys B’s land → the mortgage merges into the ownership → the mortgage right ends.

### ✅ **Conditions for Merger**

For a valid merger:  
1️⃣ There must be **two rights** — one inferior and one superior.  
2️⃣ Both rights must **meet in the same person** at the same time.  
3️⃣ The rights must be **of the same nature** and about the same subject.

---

### ✅ **Effect of Merger**

✔ The **lesser right ends** automatically.  
✔ The parties cannot claim both rights separately anymore.

---

### ✅ **Merger vs Novation**

|**Merger**|**Novation**|
|---|---|
|Right ends because a higher right absorbs it.|Right ends because a new contract replaces the old.|
|Happens automatically if conditions are met.|Needs agreement by all parties.|
|Often seen in property/secured transactions.|Common in contract substitution.|

### ✅ **Relevant Case**

**Jones v Davies (1905)** — Merger explained in property context: leasehold interest merges with freehold if same person acquires both.

---
