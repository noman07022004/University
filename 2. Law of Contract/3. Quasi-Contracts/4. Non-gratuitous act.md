### üìå 3.4 Non-gratuitous act ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: This is a broad and powerful quasi-contractual principle. It provides a legal remedy in a wide variety of situations where one person has benefited from the work or goods of another without a formal contract. It is the statutory embodiment of the principle of _quantum meruit_ (payment for services) and is crucial for ensuring fairness when one party accepts a benefit that was clearly not intended as a gift.

This principle is enshrined in **Section 70 of the Contract Act, 1872**. The term **"non-gratuitous"** simply means something that is not done for free or as a gift. The section is designed to prevent a person from enjoying a benefit without paying for it when they knew, or should have known, that the provider expected to be compensated.

#### üü° The Rule under Section 70

The section provides that if three conditions are met, the person who received the benefit must provide compensation:

##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ A person lawfully does something for another person, or delivers anything to them. 
The act must be legal. For example, a trespasser who makes improvements to a property cannot claim compensation.
    
##### 2Ô∏è‚É£ The person doing the act must not intend to do so gratuitously. 
The provider of the goods or services must have intended to be paid. This is judged objectively. A professional painter who paints a house is presumed to be acting non-gratuitously.
    
##### 3Ô∏è‚É£ The other person enjoys the benefit thereof. 
The defendant must have voluntarily accepted and enjoyed the benefit. If they had a clear opportunity to reject the benefit but chose to accept it, they are liable to pay.

#### üü° Classic Example

- **Scenario**: A, a fruit vendor, mistakenly leaves a basket of expensive mangoes at B's house, thinking it was an order for B. B knows he didn't order them, but he and his family consume the mangoes.
    
- **Action**: A discovers the mistake and asks B for payment. B refuses, arguing they never had a contract.
    
- **Outcome**: A can recover the value of the mangoes from B under Section 70.
    

**Analysis of the Example:**

- Did A deliver the mangoes **lawfully**? Yes.
    
- Did A intend to do it **gratuitously**? No, as a vendor, he intended to be paid.
    
- Did B **enjoy the benefit**? Yes, he ate the mangoes.
    

Since all three conditions are met, the law imposes a quasi-contractual obligation on B to compensate A. B cannot unjustly enrich himself by knowingly taking the benefit of an act that was not a gift.

This principle is the foundation for claims based on **quantum meruit** ("as much as he has deserved"), allowing a party to claim reasonable remuneration for services rendered or goods provided when there is no explicit contract governing payment.
