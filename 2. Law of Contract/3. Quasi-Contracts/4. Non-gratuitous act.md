## 📑 **3.4 Quasi-Contracts: Non-Gratuitous Act**

---

### ✅ **Introduction**

Sometimes, a person lawfully does something for another **without intending to do it for free** — if the other person **accepts the benefit**, they must pay for it.

This is called a **non-gratuitous act** — it is covered under **Section 70**, Indian Contract Act, 1872.

### ✅ **Legal Provision**

**📜 Section 70 — Obligation of person enjoying benefit of non-gratuitous act**

> _“Where a person lawfully does anything for another person, or delivers anything to him, not intending to do so gratuitously, and such other person enjoys the benefit thereof, the latter is bound to make compensation to the former.”_

---

### ✅ **Key Conditions**

A claim under **Section 70** is valid only if **all three conditions** are met:

1️⃣ **Lawful Act:**  
The act must be done lawfully.

2️⃣ **Non-Gratuitous Intention:**  
The act must be done **not intending it as a gift**.

3️⃣ **Enjoyment of Benefit:**  
The other person must actually **enjoy the benefit**.

If these three are present → a **quasi-contractual right to compensation** arises.

---

### ✅ **Examples**

**Example 1:**  
A mistakenly delivers goods to B. B uses the goods.  
Since A didn’t intend to gift them and B used them, B must pay A.

---

**Example 2:**  
A, a contractor, builds a wall thinking it’s part of B’s property.  
B knows about it and accepts it.  
B must pay reasonable compensation.

---

**Example 3 (No Claim):**  
If A gives a gift to B — it is a **gratuitous act** — A cannot later claim payment.

---

### ✅ **Why This Exists**

- This rule **prevents unjust enrichment**.
    
- It ensures that if you **accept a benefit**, you must pay fair value.
    
- It fills gaps when **no formal contract** exists.

### ✅ **Relevant Case**

**State of West Bengal v B.K. Mondal & Sons (1962)** —  
The government allowed a contractor to build structures, then tried to deny payment because no formal contract existed.  
Held: Under Section 70, since the government **enjoyed the benefit**, it must pay reasonable compensation.
