## 📑 **3.1 Quasi-Contracts: Definition**

---

### **Introduction**

A **quasi-contract** is not a contract in the usual sense — there is **no offer and acceptance**, no mutual consent, and no formal agreement.  
Yet, in certain circumstances, the law treats the parties **as if** there were a contract to prevent **unjust enrichment** of one party at the expense of another.

So, a **quasi-contract** is an **obligation imposed by law**, not by consent.

---

### ✅ **Legal Basis**

**Sections 68–72** of the **Indian Contract Act, 1872** explain quasi-contracts.  
These sections describe specific situations where the law imposes a duty like a contract even though the parties never agreed.

---

### ✅ **Definition**

There is **no direct definition** of a quasi-contract in the Act.  
But the concept is explained through various examples in **Sections 68–72**.

A simple working definition:  
_A quasi-contract is a legal obligation imposed by law to do justice even though no real contract exists._

---

### ✅ **Nature of Quasi-Contracts**

- **Not based on agreement:** No offer or acceptance.
    
- **Duty imposed by law:** Arises to prevent one party’s **unjust enrichment**.
    
- **Right to recover:** The person who suffers loss or provides benefit can claim reasonable compensation.

### ✅ **Examples of Quasi-Contracts**

---

### **1️⃣ Supply of Necessaries (Section 68)**

If a person supplies **necessaries** (food, medicine) to someone incapable of contracting (like a minor or lunatic), the supplier can claim reasonable payment **from that person’s property**.

**Example:**  
A supplies food to B’s minor child. A can recover the cost from B’s property.

---

### **2️⃣ Payment by Interested Person (Section 69)**

If you pay someone else’s debt to protect your own interest, you can recover it.

**Example:**  
A tenant pays property tax that B, the landlord, was supposed to pay — to prevent the house being seized. A can recover from B.

---

### **3️⃣ Non-Gratuitous Acts (Section 70)**

When you lawfully do something for someone else **without intending it as a gift**, you can demand payment if the other person enjoys the benefit.

**Example:**  
A mistakenly delivers goods to B, who uses them. B must pay A for the benefit.

---

### **4️⃣ Finder of Goods (Section 71)**

A person who finds someone else’s goods must take care of them like a bailee and return them.  
They can recover expenses for preserving the goods.

**Example:**  
A finds B’s lost watch, takes care of it, spends money for safekeeping — A can claim reasonable costs.

---

### **5️⃣ Money Paid by Mistake or Under Coercion (Section 72)**

If you pay someone money by mistake or under threat, you can demand it back.

**Example:**  
A pays tax to the government by mistake — the government must refund it.

---

### ✅ **Why Quasi-Contracts Matter**

✔ They prevent **unjust enrichment** — no one should unfairly benefit at another’s cost.  
✔ They protect fairness even when there’s **no contract**.  
✔ They are **recognized rights**, enforceable by law.

---

### ✅ **Relevant Case**

**State of West Bengal v B.K. Mondal & Sons (1962)** — The government accepted construction work done without a formal contract. The contractor recovered costs under Section 70.

---

### **Conclusion**

Quasi-contracts prove that the **law of contracts is not only about agreements** — it’s also about **fairness** and **justice**, filling gaps where consent is missing.
