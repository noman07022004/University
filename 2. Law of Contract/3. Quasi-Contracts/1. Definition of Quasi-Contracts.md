###  📌3.1 Definition ⭐⭐

>**Why Not as Critical**: This subtopic is purely theoretical and definitional. While essential for understanding the concept of quasi-contracts, the examinable substance lies in the specific applications outlined in Sections 68-72 of the Contract Act (the subsequent subtopics), rather than in the abstract definition itself.

A **quasi-contract** is not a contract at all. It is a legal fiction—an obligation created and imposed by law, regardless of any agreement between the parties. The core purpose of a quasi-contract is to provide a remedy where one party has received a benefit from another under circumstances that make it unjust for the recipient to keep the benefit without paying for it.

The foundational principle is the prevention of **unjust enrichment**. The law essentially says that no person should be allowed to get rich unjustly at another person's expense.

Unlike a true contract, which is founded on the consent and agreement of the parties (_consensus ad idem_), a quasi-contract is based on the principles of **equity, justice, and good conscience**.

#### 🟡 Key Characteristics:

- It is an obligation imposed by law, not created by an agreement.
    
- It is based on the principle of preventing unjust enrichment.
    
- The remedy is typically a right to receive a sum of money, usually equivalent to the value of the benefit conferred.
    
- It lacks the essential elements of a true contract, such as offer, acceptance, and consensus.
    

In essence, the law creates a "contract-like" obligation to ensure a fair and just outcome in situations where the parties have not formed an actual contract.
