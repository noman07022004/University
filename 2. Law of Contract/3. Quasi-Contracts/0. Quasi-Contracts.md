## 🎯 **Bigger Picture: 3. Quasi-Contracts (Sections 68–72)**

---

### **What are Quasi-Contracts?**

A **quasi-contract** is a **legal obligation imposed by law**, not by the consent of parties.  
The Indian Contract Act recognizes that sometimes a person may get a benefit unfairly — so the law forces them to compensate the other person **as if** there were a contract.

### **Why do we study Quasi-Contracts?**

✅ To understand how the law prevents **unjust enrichment** — _no one should unfairly benefit at another’s cost._  
✅ To know the situations where courts create legal rights and duties **without any agreement**.  
✅ To learn how **Sections 68–72** cover special situations: supply of necessaries, payments made to protect others, finder of goods, mistaken payments, and more.

### **Key Subtopics in This Section**

1️⃣ **Definition** (what quasi-contracts are)  
2️⃣ **Incapable Persons** — who can’t contract (like minors) but are still liable to pay for “necessaries” supplied to them.  
3️⃣ **Reimbursement** — when someone pays someone else’s legal debt to protect themselves.  
4️⃣ **Non-Gratuitous Act** — when someone does something for someone else without intending it as a gift.  
5️⃣ **Finder of Goods** — their rights and duties under law.

---

**In short:** Quasi-contracts protect fairness **when no real contract exists** — the court says: _“Act as if there was a contract.”_

---

🔑 **Big Idea:**  
👉 _Consent is missing, but obligation exists._  
👉 _Law fills the gap to ensure no one cheats or gets free benefit._
