## üìå 3. Quasi-Contracts ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: This topic deals with a unique legal concept where the law imposes an obligation on a person to prevent them from being unjustly enriched at another person's expense. While not a "true" contract, it's a vital legal remedy based on equity and fairness. Understanding this is important as it addresses situations where there is no formal agreement, but justice demands a remedy.

Quasi-contracts, often described as "contracts implied in law," are not contracts in the traditional sense. They are not based on an agreement between parties. Instead, they are legal obligations imposed by a court to prevent one person from being **unjustly enriched** at the expense of another. The entire basis of quasi-contract is the principle of equity, justice, and good conscience. It operates on the maxim that a person shall not be allowed to enrich himself unjustly at the expense of another.

The **Contract Act, 1872**, covers these obligations under the heading "Of Certain Relations Resembling Those Created by Contract" in Sections 68 to 72.

### üü° The Foundation: Prevention of Unjust Enrichment

Imagine you accidentally pay your electricity bill twice. There is no agreement with the electricity company for them to return the extra money. However, it would be unjust for them to keep it. The law, therefore, imposes a quasi-contractual obligation on them to refund the excess amount. This is the essence of this doctrine. The obligation arises not from any promise but from the necessities of justice.

### üü° Types of Quasi-Contracts

The Contract Act outlines several specific situations that are treated as quasi-contracts:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Supplying Necessaries to Incapable Persons (Section 68): 
If a person, incapable of entering into a contract (like a minor or a person of unsound mind), is supplied with **"necessaries"** suitable to their condition in life, the supplier is entitled to **reimbursement**. This reimbursement, however, is not a personal liability of the incapable person. The supplier can only recover the value of the necessaries from the **property or estate** of that person. "Necessaries" are not just bare essentials like food and clothing, but can include things like education or medical services, depending on the person's social standing.
    
#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Reimbursement for Payment of Money Due by Another (Section 69): 
This applies when a person pays a debt that another person was legally bound to pay. For the payer to be reimbursed, two conditions must be met:
    
- The payer must have an **interest** in making the payment to protect themselves from loss.
	
- The payment must not be voluntary; it must be a payment that the other party was legally obligated to make.
	
- **Example**: A is a tenant on B's land. B fails to pay the government land revenue, and the government advertises the land for sale. To prevent the sale (and his own eviction), A pays the revenue on B's behalf. A is entitled to be reimbursed by B.
        
#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Obligation for a Non-Gratuitous Act (Section 70): 
This is a broad and important principle. When a person lawfully does something for another person, or delivers something to them, **not intending to do so gratuitously** (i.e., for free), and the other person enjoys the benefit of it, the latter is bound to pay compensation.

- **Example**: A, a tradesman, leaves goods at B's house by mistake. B treats the goods as his own and uses them. B is bound to pay A for the goods. The law presumes that since B accepted the benefit, he also accepted the liability to pay for it.
        

The concept of quasi-contract is a legal fiction created to provide a remedy in situations where a formal contract is absent, but fairness dictates that one party should compensate the other for a benefit received.
