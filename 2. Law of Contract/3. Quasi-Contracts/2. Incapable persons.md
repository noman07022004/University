## 📑 **3.2 Quasi-Contracts: Incapable Persons**

---

### ✅ **Introduction**

Normally, to form a valid contract, both parties must be **competent** — meaning they must have legal capacity (**Section 11**, Indian Contract Act).  
Minors, lunatics, and persons disqualified by law **cannot** enter into binding contracts.  
**BUT** — what if someone supplies them with _necessaries_? Should they keep it for free?

**Answer:** No.  
**Section 68** creates a **quasi-contractual obligation**:  
If someone supplies **necessaries** to a person **incapable of contracting**, they can recover the reasonable cost **from that person’s property**.

### ✅ **Legal Provision**

**📜 Section 68 — Claim for necessaries supplied to persons incapable of contracting**

> _“If a person, incapable of entering into a contract, or anyone whom he is legally bound to support, is supplied by another person with necessaries suited to his condition in life, the supplier is entitled to be reimbursed from the property of such incapable person.”_

### ✅ **Who are Incapable Persons?**

- **Minors:** below 18 years.
    
- **Persons of unsound mind:** lunatics, idiots.
    
- **Persons disqualified by law:** e.g., alien enemies.

### ✅ **What are “Necessaries”?**

- Not defined strictly — it means **basic things needed for a reasonable standard of life**.
    
- Example: food, clothes, medicine, lodging, education.
    
- Must be suited to the person’s **social status**.
    

**E.g.,** Supplying luxurious jewelry to a minor is **not** a necessary. Supplying food is.

### ✅ **Who Pays?**

👉 The incapable person is **not personally liable**.  
👉 The payment is made **from their property** or estate.

### ✅ **Key Points**

- No valid contract exists — so the supplier cannot sue the person directly.
    
- The law says: to prevent **unjust enrichment**, the supplier should not suffer loss if they supplied **necessaries** in good faith.
    
- The right to be paid is a **quasi-contractual right**.

### ✅ **Practical Example**

- **Example 1:** A supplies food and medicine to B, a lunatic. A can recover reasonable costs from B’s estate.
    
- **Example 2:** A supplies educational materials to C’s minor son — A can claim expenses from C’s property.

### ✅ **Relevant Case**

**Nash v Inman (1908)** — A tailor sued a minor for the price of fancy coats. Held: Coats were not “necessaries” because the minor already had enough clothes. The tailor could not recover.
