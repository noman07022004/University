### üìå 3.2 Incapable persons ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: This is a specific and significant statutory application of the quasi-contract doctrine. It addresses the practical problem of how a person legally incapable of contracting (like a minor) can obtain essential goods and services. This rule balances the legal protection afforded to minors with the need for fairness to those who support them.

The general rule, famously established in the case of _Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose_, is that an agreement with a person incapable of contracting (such as a minor) is **void ab initio** (void from the beginning). This means a minor cannot be held liable for any promises made under an agreement.

However, a strict application of this rule could lead to harsh results, as no one would be willing to supply a minor with even the most basic necessities of life. To solve this, **Section 68 of the Contract Act, 1872**, creates a quasi-contractual obligation.

#### üü° The Rule under Section 68

The section states that if a person incapable of contracting is supplied by another person with **"necessaries"** suited to their condition in life, the supplier is entitled to be reimbursed from the **property** of such an incapable person.

Let's break down the key components:

##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ "Necessaries" 
This is the most critical concept. "Necessaries" are not just limited to bare essentials like food, clothing, and shelter. The term is flexible and depends on the social status and circumstances of the incapable person.

- **It's a relative concept**: What is a luxury for one person may be a necessary for another. For example, a car might be considered a necessary for a wealthy minor who needs it for their education.
    
- **It includes goods and services**: This can cover things like education, medical treatment, and legal services to defend the minor's property.
    
- **Existing supply matters**: An item is not a necessary if the minor already has a sufficient supply of it. For example, if a minor already has ten formal suits, an eleventh one would not be considered a necessary.
    

##### 2Ô∏è‚É£ "Reimbursement from the Property" 
This is a crucial limitation. The incapable person is **not personally liable**. The supplier cannot sue the minor directly to force them to pay.

The liability is attached only to the minor's estate or property. If the minor has no property, the supplier cannot recover anything. This provision protects the minor from personal financial ruin while still providing a mechanism for the supplier to be fairly compensated if assets are available.

In summary, Section 68 creates a remedy based on justice, ensuring that vulnerable individuals receive essential support and that suppliers of this support have a fair, albeit limited, way to be repaid.
