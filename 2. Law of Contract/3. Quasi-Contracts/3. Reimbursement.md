### üìå 3.3 Reimbursement ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: This section provides a crucial quasi-contractual remedy for a person who is compelled to pay a debt that someone else was legally obligated to pay. It is an important rule based on fairness, ensuring that a person who steps in to protect their own legitimate interests is not left out of pocket due to another's default.

This principle is contained in **Section 69 of the Contract Act, 1872**. It creates a legal right for a person to be reimbursed after paying another's legal dues under specific circumstances.

#### üü° The Rule under Section 69

The section states: _"A person who is interested in the payment of money which another is bound by law to pay, and who therefore pays it, is entitled to be reimbursed by the other."_

For this section to apply, three conditions must be satisfied:

##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ The Payer Must Have an Interest in the Payment 
The person making the payment (the plaintiff) must have a genuine, vested interest to protect. This is not a mere sentimental interest; it's a legal or proprietary interest that would be jeopardized if the payment were not made. They must be under some form of compulsion to pay to save themselves from loss.
    
##### 2Ô∏è‚É£ The Other Party Must Be Legally Bound to Pay 
The ultimate legal liability for the debt must lie with the other person (the defendant). It must be a payment that the defendant was required by law to make.
    
##### 3Ô∏è‚É£ The Payment Must Be Made to a Third Party 
The plaintiff must have made the payment to a third party to discharge the defendant's debt.

#### üü° Classic Example

The most common illustration of this principle involves a landlord-tenant relationship:

- **Scenario**: B is a landlord who owns a piece of land. He leases it to A. B is legally bound to pay the annual government revenue (land tax) for this property. B fails to pay the tax. As a result, the government authorities advertise the land for sale to recover the arrears. If the land is sold, A's lease will be terminated, and he will be evicted.
    
- **Action**: To protect his own interest (his lease), A pays the overdue tax to the government on B's behalf.
    
- **Outcome**: A is entitled to be reimbursed by B under Section 69.
    

**Analysis of the Example:**

- Was A **interested** in the payment? Yes, his lease was at risk.
    
- Was B **legally bound** to pay? Yes, as the landowner, the tax was his legal obligation.
    
- Did A make the payment? Yes.
    

Because all three conditions are met, the law imposes a quasi-contractual obligation on B to repay A. This prevents B from being unjustly enriched by having his legal debt cleared by his tenant.

Crucially, this section does not apply to a **voluntary payment**. If you simply pay your friend's electricity bill as a kind gesture without any interest of your own to protect, you cannot later sue them for reimbursement under this section.
