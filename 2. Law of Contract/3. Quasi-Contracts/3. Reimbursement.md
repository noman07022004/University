## 📑 **3.3 Quasi-Contracts: Reimbursement**

---

### ✅ **Introduction**

**Reimbursement** under quasi-contract means **recovering money** you spent **for someone else’s benefit**, when you did it to protect your own interests.

**Legal basis:** **Section 69, Indian Contract Act, 1872**

Sometimes a person **pays money** which **another person is legally bound to pay**.  
In such cases, the law says the payer **can recover** that money from the person who was actually responsible.  
This stops people from unfairly shifting their liabilities onto others.

### ✅ **Provision**

**📜 Section 69 — Reimbursement of person paying money due by another**

> _“A person who is interested in the payment of money which another is bound by law to pay, and who therefore pays it, is entitled to be reimbursed by the other.”_

---

### ✅ **Essentials**

To claim reimbursement under Section 69:

1️⃣ **Legal liability of another:**  
The other person must be **bound by law** to pay.

2️⃣ **Interest of the payer:**  
The payer must have an **interest to protect** — for example, to save property or legal rights.

3️⃣ **Voluntary payment:**  
Payment must be made **voluntarily**, not under a separate contract.

### ✅ **Examples**

---

**Example 1:**  
A owns a house leased to B. B fails to pay municipal tax.  
If A pays the tax to stop the property from being auctioned, A can recover it from B.

---

**Example 2:**  
A is a surety for B’s debt to C. B fails to pay. A pays C to protect his own liability.  
A can recover from B.

---

**Example 3:**  
X pays Y’s income tax out of charity → Not recoverable.  
Why? Because X has no legal interest to protect.

---

### ✅ **Important Points**

✔ Payment must be **compulsory** for the payer to protect their own interest.  
✔ The payer steps into the shoes of the creditor.  
✔ It is a **quasi-contractual right**, not a normal contract.

### ✅ **Relevant Case**

**Ramchandra v Sambashiv (1929)** — A mortgagee paid land revenue due by mortgagor to avoid loss of mortgaged property. Held: He could recover under Section 69.
