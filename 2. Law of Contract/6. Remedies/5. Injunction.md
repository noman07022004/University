Of course. Let's cover the next equitable remedy.

### **6.5 Injunction** ⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: An injunction is a vital equitable remedy used to prevent a breach of contract, particularly the breach of a negative promise (a promise _not_ to do something). It is a key legal tool for enforcing exclusivity agreements, non-compete clauses, and other promises where stopping a party from taking a certain action is the only effective remedy.

An **injunction** is a court order restraining a person from doing a specific act. In contract law, it is a preventative remedy. It is granted at the discretion of the court and, like specific performance, is typically only available when monetary damages are an inadequate remedy.

The primary use of an injunction in contract law is to enforce a **negative covenant**.

#### **Enforcing Negative Promises**

While a court will not grant specific performance for a contract of personal service (it won't force someone to work), it can issue an injunction to stop that person from breaking a negative promise within that same contract.

- **Landmark Case**: The principle comes from the famous case of **_Lumley v Wagner (1852)_**.
    
    - **Facts**: A famous opera singer (Wagner) was contracted to sing exclusively at a specific theatre (Lumley's). The contract included a **negative covenant** that she would not sing at any other theatre during that period. She then agreed to sing for a rival theatre.
        
    - **Held**: The court could **not** order specific performance to force her to sing for Lumley. However, it granted an **injunction** to prevent her from singing for the rival theatre.
        
    - **Rationale**: This did not force her to sing, but it encouraged her to fulfill her original contract by preventing her from performing elsewhere.
        

**Example** An actor signs an exclusive one-year contract with Studio A, which includes a promise not to work for any other studio during that year. If the actor tries to make a film with Studio B during that time, Studio A can get an injunction to stop them.

The rules governing injunctions in Bangladesh are found in the **Specific Relief Act, 1877**.
