### **6.3 Quantum Meruit** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Why Important**: This is a crucial restitutionary remedy that allows a person to be paid for the value of the work they have performed when a formal contract is unenforceable or has been discharged before completion. It's a key legal tool for achieving fairness and preventing one party from being unjustly enriched by the labor of another.

_Quantum Meruit_ is a Latin phrase that means **"as much as he has deserved"** or **"as much as is earned."**

It is not a claim for damages due to a breach of contract. Instead, it is a claim for a **reasonable sum of money** in return for services rendered or work done, where the price for those services was not fixed in a contract. The claim is based on an implied promise to pay for the benefit that has been accepted.

#### **When a Claim for Quantum Meruit Arises**

A claim for quantum meruit can be made in several situations:

**1. When an Agreement is Discovered to be Void** If work has been done under an agreement which is later found to be void, the party who has performed the work can claim reasonable payment for it. This is based on the principle of restitution in **Section 65** of the Contract Act.

**2. For a Non-Gratuitous Act (Section 70)** As discussed earlier, if a person provides a service not intending to do so for free, and the other person accepts the benefit, the provider is entitled to reasonable compensation. This is the statutory basis for many quantum meruit claims.

**3. When a Contract is Discharged by Breach** If the innocent party has already performed part of the contract before the other party's breach puts an end to it, the innocent party has a choice: they can either sue for damages for the breach of the full contract, or they can sue on a quantum meruit basis for the value of the work they have already completed.

- **Example**: A contractor agrees to build a wall for BDT 50,000. After completing half the work, B wrongfully prevents the contractor from finishing. The contractor can claim quantum meruit for the value of the work already done (e.g., BDT 25,000). üß±
    

**4. When a Contract is Divisible** If a contract is made up of distinct parts, and a party performs some but not all of them, they can often claim payment on a quantum meruit basis for the parts they have completed.
