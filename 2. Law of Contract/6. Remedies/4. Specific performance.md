### **6.4 Specific performance** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Why Important**: This is a powerful equitable remedy that provides perfect justice in cases where monetary damages are simply not enough. Understanding the specific and limited circumstances in which a court will abandon damages and instead force a party to actually perform their promise is a key part of the law of remedies.

**Specific performance** is a court order compelling a party to perform their contractual obligations exactly as they promised. It is an **equitable remedy**, which means it is not granted as a right but at the discretion of the court.

The fundamental principle is that specific performance will only be granted when **monetary damages are an inadequate remedy** for the breach of contract.

#### **When is Specific Performance Granted?**

The court typically grants specific performance in the following situations, which are also outlined in the **Specific Relief Act, 1877**:

**1. Contracts for the Sale of Land/Immovable Property** This is the most common scenario for specific performance.

- **Rationale**: Every piece of land is considered unique. Its location and features cannot be replicated. Therefore, money is not an adequate substitute for the specific property the buyer contracted for.
    
- **Example**: A agrees to sell his house to B, but later breaches the contract. B can ask the court for an order of specific performance to force A to transfer the ownership of the house. üè°
    

**2. Contracts for Unique or Rare Goods** When the contract is for the sale of a specific item that is rare or has unique value, damages are inadequate because the buyer cannot simply use the money to buy an identical substitute.

- **Examples**: A contract to sell a one-of-a-kind painting by a famous artist, a specific antique, or shares in a private company that are not available on the open market.
    

**3. When Damages are Difficult to Calculate** If the loss suffered by the innocent party is impossible to quantify in monetary terms, the court may order specific performance.

#### **When is Specific Performance NOT Granted?**

The court will refuse to grant specific performance in several cases:

- **Where Damages are Adequate**: For contracts involving ordinary, non-unique goods (like rice, oil, or a mass-produced car), damages are an adequate remedy. The buyer can take the money and buy the goods elsewhere.
    
- **Contracts for Personal Services**: The court will **never** order specific performance of a contract of employment or for personal services (e.g., forcing a singer to perform). This is because it would be an unacceptable restriction on personal liberty, akin to slavery, and it would be impossible for the court to supervise the quality of the performance.
    
- **Contracts Requiring Constant Supervision**: The court will not grant specific performance for contracts that are complex and would require the court's constant supervision to ensure they are performed correctly (e.g., a large-scale construction contract).
    
- **Where the Contract is Unfair**: As an equitable remedy, the party seeking it must have acted fairly ("come with clean hands"). The court will not enforce a contract that is fundamentally unfair or unconscionable.
