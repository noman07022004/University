Of course. Let's start with the most important remedy in contract law.

### **6.1 Amount of Damages** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: Damages are the primary and most common remedy for a breach of contract. This topic explains the fundamental legal principles used to calculate the amount of money an innocent party is entitled to. The rules on remoteness, stemming from the landmark case of _Hadley v Baxendale_, are a cornerstone of contract law and are essential for any analysis of a breach.

The purpose of awarding damages is not to punish the party in breach, but to **compensate** the innocent party for their financial loss. The goal is to put the innocent party in the same financial position they would have been in if the contract had been performed properly.

The principles for assessing the amount of damages are codified in **Section 73 of the Contract Act, 1872**, which is based on the famous English case of **_Hadley v Baxendale (1854)_**. The rule established in this case, often called the "rule of remoteness," is broken down into two parts.

#### **1. Ordinary (or General) Damages**

This is the first limb of the rule. The aggrieved party is entitled to recover compensation for any loss or damage which **naturally arose in the usual course of things** from the breach.

- **Explanation**: This covers direct, predictable, and foreseeable losses. It is the loss that any reasonable person would expect to occur as a result of such a breach.
    
- **Example**: A agrees to sell 100 kg of sugar to B for BDT 80 per kg. On the delivery date, A fails to deliver. The market price for sugar on that day has risen to BDT 90 per kg. B's ordinary damage is the difference between the market price and the contract price.
    
    - Loss = (Market Price - Contract Price) x Quantity
        
    - Loss = (BDT 90 - BDT 80) x 100 kg = **BDT 1,000**. This amount compensates B for the extra money he must now spend to get the same sugar from another seller.

#### **2. Special Damages**

This is the second limb of the rule. This refers to losses that do not arise naturally but result from special or unusual circumstances. A party can only claim special damages if they can prove that the other party **knew, at the time the contract was made,** about the special circumstances that would lead to such a loss.

- **Explanation**: The breaching party must have had knowledge of the potential for this specific, unusual loss. This knowledge makes the loss foreseeable to them.
    
- **Example (based on _Hadley v Baxendale_)**: A's flour mill stops working because of a broken crankshaft. He gives the broken shaft to B, a carrier, to transport for repairs. A tells B, "This is our only crankshaft, and the entire mill is stopped until we get it back. Please be quick." B unreasonably delays the delivery. Here, A can claim his lost profits from the mill's closure as **special damages**. Why? Because A put B on notice of the special circumstance (the stopped mill), making the loss of profits a foreseeable consequence of the delay. If A had not told B this, the loss of profit would be too remote, and A could not claim it.

#### **Duty to Mitigate Loss**

There is a crucial principle that accompanies the law of damages: the innocent party has a **duty to mitigate their loss**. This means they must take all reasonable steps to minimize the damage caused by the breach. They cannot simply stand by, let the losses accumulate, and then claim the full amount from the breaching party.

- **Example**: In the sugar example above, B has a duty to go into the market and buy replacement sugar at the current price of BDT 90. He cannot wait two weeks for the price to rise to BDT 120 and then claim the larger loss. He can only claim for the loss that was unavoidable.
