### **6.6 Restitution of benefit** ⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This is a fundamental principle of justice that underpins many legal remedies. It's the law's way of preventing one person from being unfairly enriched at another's expense. It is the core concept behind quasi-contracts and is the primary remedy when a contract is found to be void or is frustrated.

**Restitution** means the act of restoring something that has been lost or taken away. In contract law, it is the remedy that requires a party to return a benefit that they have received from another party when the contract fails or is unwound.

The goal of restitution is **not** to compensate a party for their loss (like damages), but to **prevent the unjust enrichment** of the other party.

#### **Statutory Basis in the Contract Act**

The principle of restitution is embedded in several key sections of the Act:

**1. Following Rescission of a Voidable Contract (Section 64)** When a party exercises their right to rescind a voidable contract (e.g., due to fraud or misrepresentation), they **must restore** any benefit they have received under that contract.

- **Rationale**: You cannot cancel a contract and, at the same time, keep the benefits you received from it. The goal is to put both parties back in their original positions.
    
- **Example**: A is induced by B's misrepresentation to buy a bicycle for BDT 10,000. A rescinds the contract. A must return the bicycle to B, and B must refund the BDT 10,000 to A.
    

**2. When a Contract Becomes Void (Section 65)** This is a very broad and important rule. It applies when an agreement is discovered to be void or when a contract later becomes void. In such cases, any party who has received an advantage must restore it or pay compensation for it.

- **This is the key remedy for**:
    
    - **Frustration**: A pays an advance to B to hire a venue. The venue burns down. The contract becomes void. B must return the advance to A.
        
    - **Void Agreements**: An agreement is made with a minor who receives a benefit. The minor must restore that benefit.

#### **Restitution vs. Damages**

It's crucial to understand the difference:

- **Damages** are **loss-based**. They look forward and aim to put the innocent party in the position they would have been in if the contract had been **performed**.
    
- **Restitution** is **gain-based**. It looks backward and aims to take away the unfair gain from the defendant and return it to the plaintiff, restoring the original position.
