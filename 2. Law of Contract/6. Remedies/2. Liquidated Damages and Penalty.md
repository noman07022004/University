Of course. Let's cover the next subtopic.

### **6.2 Liquidated Damages and Penalty** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: It's very common for commercial contracts to contain clauses that specify a pre-agreed amount of damages for a breach. This topic explains how the law treats these clauses, balancing the parties' freedom to set their own terms against the court's power to prevent one party from imposing an oppressive penalty on the other.

Parties to a contract often want to avoid the difficulty and uncertainty of proving their losses in court. To do this, they may include a clause that stipulates a specific sum of money to be paid by the breaching party. The law, however, scrutinizes these clauses carefully.

#### **The Distinction**

- **Liquidated Damages**: This is a **genuine and reasonable pre-estimate** of the loss that would likely be suffered from a breach. The amount is fair and based on a calculation of potential harm. Courts will generally enforce such a clause.
    
- **Penalty**: This is a sum that is **extravagant and unconscionable** compared to the greatest possible loss that could follow from the breach. Its purpose is not to compensate the innocent party, but to **terrorize** the other party into performing the contract. Courts will not enforce a penalty clause.

#### **The Law in Bangladesh: Section 74**

The **Contract Act, 1872**, takes a unique approach. **Section 74** largely does away with the English law distinction between "liquidated damages" and "penalty." The label that the parties use in the contract is not important.

The rule under Section 74 is as follows: If a contract names a sum to be paid in case of a breach, the innocent party is entitled to receive **reasonable compensation _not exceeding_ the amount so named.**

**This means:**

1. The stipulated sum is not automatically awarded. The innocent party cannot claim the full amount just because it's in the contract.
    
2. The innocent party must still prove that they have suffered a loss.
    
3. The pre-agreed amount acts as a **cap or a maximum limit** on the compensation that can be awarded.
    

**Example**

- **Scenario**: A contractor agrees to complete a project by June 1st. The contract states that he must pay a "penalty" of BDT 500,000 for any delay. He is one month late. The actual loss suffered by the client (e.g., in lost rent) is BDT 300,000.
    
- **Outcome under Section 74**: The court will not automatically award BDT 500,000. It will assess the actual loss and grant **reasonable compensation**, which is BDT 300,000. The BDT 500,000 figure only serves as the maximum amount the client could have claimed if their loss had been that high or higher.
