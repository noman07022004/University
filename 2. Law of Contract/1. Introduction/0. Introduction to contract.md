### **Introduction**

A contract is an agreement creating and defining enforceable rights and obligations between parties. The **law of contract** forms the backbone of commercial transactions by providing a legal framework for promises to be kept and disputes to be resolved fairly. The Indian Contract Act, 1872 ‚Äî still in force in Bangladesh ‚Äî codifies the principles and rules governing contracts.

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ History and Development**

The concept of contract evolved from ancient customs to modern codified law.

- **Ancient roots:** Roman law recognized formal contracts (_contractus_) based on strict forms. Hindu law (_Dharma≈õƒÅstra_) and Islamic law (_Fiqh_) contained early rules for agreements, trade, and duties.
    
- **English Common Law:** Developed the modern idea of _freedom of contract_, enforced through precedents.
    
- **Codification:** The Indian Contract Act, 1872 unified these principles for the Indian subcontinent under British rule. After independence, Bangladesh retained this Act with slight modifications.
    
- Today, courts adapt contract law to new forms such as e-contracts and digital agreements, ensuring its relevance.

- _Consensus ad idem_ ensures parties genuinely agree.
    
- _Consideration_ is the price for a promise ‚Äî ‚ÄúNo consideration, no contract.‚Äù

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Essential Elements of a Valid Contract**

**Section 10** lays down that an agreement is a contract if it is made:

- By free consent of competent parties,
    
- For a lawful object and consideration,
    
- Not expressly declared void,
    
- With certainty and possibility of performance,
    
- Fulfilling any required legal formalities.
    

If any element is missing, the agreement is void, voidable, or unenforceable.

---

### **Example**

A written agreement where A agrees to sell his house to B for Tk. 50 lakh:

- Valid offer and acceptance,
    
- Intention to create legal relations,
    
- Lawful consideration (money),
    
- Competent parties,
    
- Free consent,
    
- Clear and lawful object,
    
- Follows legal formality (must be registered).
    

Therefore, this is a valid contract under the Indian Contract Act, 1872.

### **Conclusion**

In summary, the **Introduction** to contract law covers its historical roots, modern character, core principles, basis, and essential elements that make agreements legally enforceable. Together, these rules provide fairness, certainty, and trust in personal and commercial dealings in Bangladesh.

> This main topic is maximally important as it sets the foundational context for the entire course, integrating historical evolution, core characteristics, principles, bases, and essential elements of contract law under the Indian Contract Act, 1872 (applicable in Bangladesh). It directly supports Course Learning Outcomes 1 (nature and value of contracts) and 4 (formal requirements for validity), making it essential for conceptual understanding and exam questions on contract fundamentals.

### **üìå Introduction**

The "Introduction" to the Law of Contract course provides a comprehensive overview of the conceptual framework governing contracts, drawing from the **Indian Contract Act, 1872**, which serves as the primary statute in Bangladesh. This topic explores the historical roots, modern attributes, guiding principles, underlying rationale, and core requirements for forming valid contracts. It emphasizes how contract law has evolved to facilitate reliable agreements in society, ensuring fairness, enforceability, and economic stability. In Bangladesh's context, where the Act blends colonial English common law with local adaptations (e.g., for consumer protection and digital transactions), this introduction highlights contracts as voluntary, binding promises that promote trust in commercial, personal, and international dealings. Understanding this topic is vital for grasping subsequent areas like formation, performance, and remedies, as it establishes why contracts matter and how they are structured legally.

### **üîë Key Aspects and Recap of Subtopics**

This section recaps the subtopics in a structured manner, linking them cohesively for quick revision. Each builds on the others to form a complete picture of contract law's foundation.

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ History and Development**

- **Recap:** Contract law originated in ancient civilizations (e.g., Babylonian Code of Hammurabi, Roman law) with formalities like seals. In medieval England, it evolved through writs (debt, covenant) to the action of assumpsit in the 16th century, emphasizing enforceable promises. The Industrial Revolution led to codification, culminating in the Indian Contract Act, 1872, drafted under British rule. In Bangladesh, post-independence, the Act remains with amendments for modern needs like e-contracts.
- **Connection to Topic:** Provides historical context, showing evolution from rigid forms to flexible, intent-based systems, influencing Bangladesh's legal framework.

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Character of Modern Contracts**

- **Recap:** Modern contracts feature freedom of contract (with legal limits), consensual nature (mutual consent), flexibility (express/implied, unilateral/bilateral), enforceability, protection for weaker parties (e.g., against undue influence), and a global/commercial focus. In Bangladesh, they adapt to digital and consumer scenarios under the Contract Act, 1872, and supplementary laws like the ICT Act, 2006.
- **Connection to Topic:** Illustrates how contracts function today, balancing autonomy with fairness in Bangladesh's economy (e.g., RMG sector).

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Principles of Contract**

- **Recap:** Core principles include pacta sunt servanda (agreements must be kept), freedom of contract, consensus ad idem (meeting of minds), privity of contract (only parties bound), lawful consideration, good faith, and equality. These are implied or explicit in the Contract Act, 1872, with protections against coercion or fraud.
- **Connection to Topic:** These doctrines guide contract interpretation and enforcement, ensuring ethical and legal validity in Bangladesh's diverse contexts.

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Basis of Contract Law**

- **Recap:** Contract law is based on enforcing promises for economic/social stability, protecting autonomy, ensuring equity/fairness, upholding moral obligations, and adapting to modern changes. Rooted in the Contract Act, 1872, it supports trust in transactions while addressing inequalities.
- **Connection to Topic:** Explains the "why" behind contract law, justifying its role in Bangladesh's legal system for predictable dealings.

#### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Essential Elements of Contract**

- **Recap:** A valid contract requires: (1) Agreement (offer and acceptance, Sections 2(a)-2(b)); (2) Lawful consideration (Section 2(d), real and legal); (3) Competent parties (Section 11, majority/sound mind); (4) Free consent (Section 14, free from coercion/undue influence/fraud/misrepresentation/mistake); (5) Lawful object (Section 23, not immoral/illegal); (6) Not expressly void (Sections 24-30, e.g., no restraint of trade); (7) Intention to create legal relations (judicially implied). Missing any renders it invalid.
- **Connection to Topic:** Outlines the "how" of validity, tying directly to Section 10 of the Act and forming the threshold for all contracts in Bangladesh.

---

### **üåê Additional Context for Understanding**

- **Bangladesh-Specific Insights:** The Contract Act, 1872, applies uniformly but intersects with other laws like the Specific Relief Act, 1877 (for remedies), Consumer Rights Protection Act, 2009 (for fairness), and Islamic principles in certain contracts (e.g., avoiding riba/usury). Judicial precedents from Bangladesh High Court and Supreme Court often interpret the Act progressively, e.g., recognizing electronic signatures.
- **Societal Value:** Contracts underpin Bangladesh's economy (e.g., trade, employment) and society (e.g., family settlements), reducing disputes and promoting growth. Globally, influences like UN conventions on sales shape international contracts.
- **Common Pitfalls in Exams:** Always reference Act sections; distinguish void vs. voidable; use examples from Bangladeshi contexts (e.g., land disputes).
- **Interconnections:** This topic links to later syllabus areas‚Äîe.g., essential elements feed into formation (Topic 2), while principles inform remedies (Topic 6).
