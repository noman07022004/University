## 📌 1. Introduction ⭐⭐⭐⭐

>**Why Important**: This topic is the bedrock upon which the entire study of contract law is built. It provides the essential vocabulary, historical context, and theoretical framework necessary to understand all subsequent topics. Mastering this section ensures you grasp the 'why' behind the legal rules, not just the 'what'. It is fundamental for conceptual clarity and is often the source of introductory questions in examinations.

A contract, in its simplest form, is a legally enforceable promise or set of promises. It is the primary legal mechanism through which individuals and businesses in a market economy create binding obligations for themselves. The law of contract is not concerned with any and all agreements; its domain is specifically those agreements that the law will recognize and enforce, providing a remedy if one party fails to perform their undertaking. This introductory topic explores the origins, principles, and foundational elements that give a contract its legal significance.

### 🟡 History, Development, and Basis of Contract Law

The modern law of contract is primarily a product of English Common Law, developed over centuries by judges. Its origins can be traced to medieval writs, particularly the action of _assumpsit_, which allowed a person to sue for damages arising from a poorly performed undertaking. This marked a crucial shift from a society governed by **status** (where rights and duties were determined by one's position in society, e.g., lord and serf) to one governed by **contract** (where individuals could freely determine their own rights and obligations).

The 18th and 19th centuries, fueled by the Industrial Revolution and the philosophy of _laissez-faire_ (let it be), saw the rise of the classical theory of contract. This theory championed two core principles:

##### 1. **Freedom of Contract**: 
- The idea that parties are the best judges of their own interests and should be free to negotiate and agree to any terms they see fit, with minimal state intervention.

##### 2. **Sanctity of Contract**: 
- The principle that once a contract is freely entered into, it is sacred (_pacta sunt servanda_ - agreements must be kept) and should be enforced by the courts as written.

The philosophical basis of this classical model is the **Will Theory**, which posits that a contract represents the consensus of the parties' wills (_consensus ad idem_ or a "meeting of the minds"). The law's role is simply to give effect to this joint intention.

In the **Bangladeshi context**, the law of contract is codified and primarily governed by the **Contract Act, 1872**. This Act was enacted during the British colonial period and is based on the principles of English Common Law. Therefore, while Bangladesh has a statutory framework, judicial decisions from England, India, and other common law jurisdictions remain highly persuasive in interpreting its provisions.

### 🟡 Character of Modern Contracts and Guiding Principles

While the classical principles of freedom and sanctity remain influential, modern contract law has evolved to address the complexities of contemporary society. The character of modern contracts often deviates from the classical model of two parties of equal bargaining power negotiating terms face-to-face. A dominant feature today is the **standard form contract** (or contract of adhesion), where one party (usually a large corporation) presents pre-drafted terms on a "take-it-or-leave-it" basis to the other party (usually a consumer). Examples include mobile phone agreements, insurance policies, and software licenses. This reality has challenged the notion of genuine consent and led to legislative and judicial interventions to protect the weaker party from unconscionable or unfair terms.

This evolution reflects a shift from pure _laissez-faire_ to a model that balances contractual freedom with principles of fairness and the protection of reasonable expectations. The guiding principle is now the **objective theory of contract**. Courts are not concerned with what a party subjectively intended but with what a reasonable person, observing the parties' words and conduct, would conclude they intended. This ensures certainty and protects the reliance interest of the parties.

### 🟡 The Essential Elements of a Valid Contract

For an agreement to be recognized as a legally enforceable contract, it must contain several essential elements. Section 10 of the Contract Act, 1872, states, _"All agreements are contracts if they are made by the free consent of parties competent to contract, for a lawful consideration and with a lawful object, and are not hereby expressly declared to be void."_

Combining this with common law principles, the universally recognized essential elements are:

##### 1. Agreement (Offer and Acceptance): 
- One party must make a clear and certain offer, and the other party must provide an unconditional acceptance of that offer.
    
##### 2. Intention to Create Legal Relations: 
- The parties must intend for their agreement to have legal consequences. This is presumed in commercial agreements but is generally presumed to be absent in social or domestic arrangements.
    
##### 3. Consideration: 
- Each party must provide something of value (an act, forbearance, or promise) in exchange for the other's promise. It is the "price" for which the promise of the other is bought.
    
##### 4. Capacity to Contract: 
- The parties must be legally capable of entering into a contract. This generally excludes minors, persons of unsound mind, and those disqualified by law.
    
##### 5. Free Consent: 
- The consent of the parties must be genuine and not obtained through coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation, or mistake.
    
##### 6. Lawful Object and Consideration: 
- The purpose of the agreement and the consideration provided must be legal and not contrary to public policy.
    
##### 7. Certainty of Terms: 
- The terms of the agreement must be clear, complete, and not vague or ambiguous.
    
##### 8. Possibility of Performance: 
- The obligations undertaken must be capable of being performed. An agreement to do an impossible act is void.
    
##### 9. Compliance with Legal Formalities: 
- While most contracts can be oral, some specific types are required by law to be in writing and/or registered to be enforceable.

An agreement that fails to satisfy one or more of these essential elements may be deemed **void** (a nullity from the beginning), **voidable** (valid until rescinded by the aggrieved party), or **unenforceable** (valid but cannot be enforced in a court of law). This framework of essential elements forms the roadmap for analyzing the formation and validity of any contract.
