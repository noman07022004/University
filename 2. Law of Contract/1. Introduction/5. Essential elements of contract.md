### üìå 1.5 Essential elements of contract ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: This is the master checklist for contract law. Every single purported agreement must be measured against these elements to determine if a legally enforceable contract exists. It forms the syllabus for the entire "Formation of Contract" topic and is the most fundamental, critical, and heavily-tested concept. If you do not know these elements, you cannot analyze a contract problem.

For an agreement to be a contract, it's not enough for two parties to simply agree on something. The agreement must satisfy a series of mandatory requirements‚Äîthe essential elements. The absence of even one of these elements will prevent a valid contract from being formed.

In Bangladesh, the primary source for these elements is **Section 10 of the Contract Act, 1872**, which states: _"All agreements are contracts if they are made by the free consent of parties competent to contract, for a lawful consideration and with a lawful object, and are not hereby expressly declared to be void."_

Combining this statutory provision with established common law principles, we get the complete list of essentials:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Agreement (Offer and Acceptance) 
This is the heart of any contract. An agreement is formed when one party (the offeror) makes a definite proposal (the **offer**), and the other party (the offeree) gives an absolute and unconditional consent to that proposal (the **acceptance**). This creates a "meeting of the minds" or _consensus ad idem_.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Intention to Create Legal Relations
The parties must intend for their agreement to be legally binding and enforceable in a court of law. The law applies two important presumptions:

- **Commercial Agreements**: It is presumed that parties **do** intend to create legal relations.
    
- **Domestic or Social Agreements**: In agreements between family members or friends, it is presumed that parties **do not** intend to create legal relations. Both presumptions can be rebutted by clear evidence to the contrary.
    

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Lawful Consideration 
A contract is a bargain. Consideration is the price for which the promise of the other is bought, often summarized by the Latin maxim **_quid pro quo_** ("something for something"). Each party must give or promise to give something of value in the eyes of the law. This could be an act, a forbearance (refraining from doing something), or a promise. The consideration must be lawful, but it does not need to be adequate (the court won't question the fairness of the price, just that there was a price).

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Capacity to Contract 
The law requires that the parties to a contract be legally competent. Section 11 of the Contract Act, 1872, specifies that a person is competent if they are:

- Of the **age of majority** (not a minor).
    
- Of **sound mind** (not mentally incapacitated).
    
- Not otherwise **disqualified from contracting** by any law. This protects vulnerable individuals from being bound by agreements they may not fully understand.
    

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Free Consent 
For a contract to be valid, the consent of the parties must be genuine and voluntary. According to Section 14 of the Act, consent is not free if it is caused by any of the following "vitiating factors":

- **Coercion** (threats of violence).
    
- **Undue Influence** (improper use of a position of power).
    
- **Fraud** (intentional deception).
    
- **Misrepresentation** (unintentional false statements).
    
- **Mistake** (a fundamental error about the facts or law). If consent is not free, the contract is typically **voidable** at the option of the aggrieved party.
    

#### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Lawful Object and Consideration 
The purpose (object) of the agreement, as well as the consideration exchanged, must be lawful. Section 23 of the Act declares an object or consideration unlawful if it is forbidden by law, fraudulent, involves injury to person or property, or is considered by the court to be immoral or against public policy. An agreement with an unlawful object is **void**.

#### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Certainty of Terms 
The terms of the agreement must not be vague or uncertain. The rights and obligations of the parties must be clearly defined. An agreement to "sell a hundred tons of oil" without specifying the kind of oil is void for uncertainty.

#### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Possibility of Performance 
The obligations undertaken in the agreement must be capable of being performed. An agreement to do an act that is impossible in itself, such as discovering treasure by magic, is **void**.

**Important Note**: Think of these elements like ingredients for a cake üéÇ. To bake a valid cake, you need all the key ingredients in the right measure. If you're missing even one‚Äîlike flour or eggs‚Äîyou don't have a cake. Similarly, for an agreement to become a legally valid contract, **all** of these essential elements must be present. The absence of any one element will be fatal to the formation of the contract.
