### **üìå Introduction**

The essential elements of a contract are the fundamental components required to make an agreement legally enforceable under the **Indian Contract Act, 1872**, which governs contract law in Bangladesh. Section 10 of the Act states that a contract is an agreement enforceable by law, provided it meets specific criteria. These elements ensure that contracts reflect genuine mutual intent, fairness, and legality, forming the backbone of contractual obligations in personal, commercial, and digital transactions. Understanding these elements is crucial for determining whether an agreement is valid, void, or voidable, especially in Bangladesh‚Äôs legal and economic context.

### **üîë Essential Elements of a Valid Contract**

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Agreement (Offer and Acceptance)**

- **Definition:** A contract begins with an agreement, which requires a valid offer (proposal) by one party and its acceptance by another.
- **Legal Basis:** 
  - **Section 2(a):** An offer is a proposal where one party expresses willingness to do or abstain from doing something to obtain another‚Äôs assent.
  - **Section 2(b):** Acceptance occurs when the offeree agrees to the proposal without modifications.
- **Requirements:**
  - Offer must be clear, definite, and communicated (Section 4).
  - Acceptance must be absolute, unqualified, and communicated within a reasonable time (Section 7).
  - There must be a ‚Äúmeeting of minds‚Äù (consensus ad idem).
- **Significance:** Ensures both parties mutually agree on the same terms, forming the basis of the contract.
- **Example:** A shopkeeper offers to sell a phone for Tk. 20,000, and the buyer accepts the price. If the buyer demands a discount after agreeing, there‚Äôs no valid acceptance.
- **Bangladesh Context:** Common in property sales or commercial deals; courts scrutinize offer and acceptance in disputes (e.g., land agreements).
- **Case:** *Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. (1893)* ‚Äì An advertisement was deemed a unilateral offer, accepted by performance, showing how agreement is formed.

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Lawful Consideration**

- **Definition:** Consideration is something of value (act, abstinence, or promise) given by one party in exchange for the other‚Äôs promise or act.
- **Legal Basis:** 
  - **Section 2(d):** Consideration is what is done or promised at the desire of the promisor.
  - **Section 25:** An agreement without consideration is void, except in cases like gifts or promises based on natural love and affection (if written and registered).
- **Requirements:**
  - Must be lawful (not illegal, immoral, or against public policy, per Section 23).
  - Need not be adequate (e.g., selling a car for Tk. 1 is valid if intentional) but must be real (not illusory).
  - Must move from the promisee or another at their desire.
- **Significance:** Ensures mutuality, distinguishing enforceable contracts from gratuitous promises.
- **Example:** A agrees to repair B‚Äôs car for Tk. 5,000. B‚Äôs payment is consideration for A‚Äôs service, making the contract valid.
- **Bangladesh Context:** Courts enforce consideration in business contracts (e.g., service agreements) but may uphold registered family settlements without consideration (Section 25).
- **Case:** *Chinnaya v Ramaya (1882)* ‚Äì A gift deed with consideration (delivery of property) was upheld as valid.

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Competent Parties**

- **Definition:** Parties entering the contract must have the legal capacity to contract.
- **Legal Basis:** 
  - **Section 11:** Competent parties are those who are of the age of majority (18 under the Majority Act, 1875), of sound mind, and not disqualified by law.
  - **Section 12:** A person is of sound mind if they can understand the contract and its effects at the time of making it.
- **Disqualifications:**
  - Minors (under 18) cannot make binding contracts, except for necessities (Section 68).
  - Persons of unsound mind (e.g., lunatics, except during lucid intervals) or those disqualified (e.g., insolvents under bankruptcy laws) are incompetent.
- **Significance:** Protects vulnerable individuals and ensures parties understand their obligations.
- **Example:** A 16-year-old signing a lease agreement cannot be held liable, but a contract for food supplied to them may be enforceable.
- **Bangladesh Context:** Often arises in family or property disputes involving minors or mentally incapacitated persons.
- **Case:** *Mohori Bibee v Dharmodas Ghose (1903)* ‚Äì A minor‚Äôs mortgage was void, as minors lack capacity.

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Free Consent**

- **Definition:** Consent must be given freely, without being vitiated by external factors that undermine voluntary agreement.
- **Legal Basis:** 
  - **Section 14:** Consent is free when not caused by coercion (Section 15), undue influence (Section 16), fraud (Section 17), misrepresentation (Section 18), or mistake (Sections 20-22).
- **Requirements:**
  - Coercion: Threatening unlawful acts to force agreement (e.g., blackmail).
  - Undue influence: Exploiting a position of power (e.g., employer over employee).
  - Fraud: Intentional deception to induce agreement.
  - Misrepresentation: Untrue statements made innocently.
  - Mistake: Mutual (both parties mistaken about facts) or unilateral (one party mistaken, generally not void unless induced by fraud).
- **Significance:** Ensures agreements reflect genuine intent, protecting against exploitation.
- **Example:** If a lender forces a borrower to sign a loan by threatening violence, the contract is voidable due to coercion.
- **Bangladesh Context:** Critical in rural loan agreements or family arrangements, where undue influence or coercion may occur.
- **Case:** *Ranganayakamma v Alwar Setti (1889)* ‚Äì A widow‚Äôs consent under pressure was deemed not free, voiding the contract.

#### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Lawful Object and Consideration**

- **Definition:** The purpose (object) of the contract and the consideration must be legal and not against public policy.
- **Legal Basis:** 
  - **Section 23:** An agreement is unlawful if its object or consideration is forbidden by law, defeats legal provisions, is fraudulent, involves injury to person/property, or is immoral/opposed to public policy.
- **Examples of Unlawful Objects:**
  - Contracts for illegal activities (e.g., smuggling).
  - Agreements to defraud (e.g., tax evasion).
  - Immoral agreements (e.g., prostitution) or those harming public interest (e.g., restraining trade, Section 27).
- **Significance:** Prevents contracts from undermining societal or legal norms.
- **Example:** A contract to sell prohibited drugs is void, as the object is illegal.
- **Bangladesh Context:** Courts strike down agreements violating Islamic law principles (e.g., usurious loans) or public policy (e.g., anti-competitive trade practices).
- **Case:** *Gherulal Parakh v Mahadeodas (1959)* ‚Äì An agreement for wagering (not contingent contracts) was void as against public policy.

#### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Not Expressly Declared Void**

- **Definition:** The agreement must not fall under categories explicitly deemed void by the Contract Act, 1872.
- **Legal Basis:** Sections 24-30 list void agreements, including:
  - Agreements with unlawful consideration/object (Section 24).
  - Agreements without consideration (Section 25, except exceptions).
  - Agreements in restraint of marriage (Section 26), trade (Section 27), or legal proceedings (Section 28).
  - Uncertain agreements (Section 29).
  - Wagering agreements (Section 30).
- **Significance:** Ensures only legally permissible agreements are enforceable.
- **Example:** An agreement to prevent someone from marrying is void under Section 26.
- **Bangladesh Context:** Common in disputes over trade restraints or wagering (e.g., betting contracts not recognized as enforceable).
- **Case:** *Madhub Chunder v Rajcoomar (1874)* ‚Äì An agreement restraining trade was void under Section 27.

#### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Intention to Create Legal Relations**

- **Definition:** Parties must intend their agreement to have legal consequences, distinguishing social or domestic agreements from contracts.
- **Legal Basis:** Not explicitly stated in the Contract Act, 1872, but implied through judicial interpretation and common law principles.
- **Requirements:**
  - Commercial agreements are presumed to have legal intent unless proven otherwise.
  - Social/domestic agreements (e.g., family promises) are presumed non-binding unless clear intent is shown.
- **Significance:** Ensures only serious commitments are enforceable, avoiding frivolous lawsuits.
- **Example:** A business agreement to supply goods intends legal obligation, but a promise to meet a friend for dinner typically does not.
- **Bangladesh Context:** Relevant in family settlements (e.g., property divisions), where intent must be clear to enforce.
- **Case:** *Balfour v Balfour (1919)* ‚Äì A husband‚Äôs promise to pay his wife maintenance was not enforceable due to lack of legal intent.
