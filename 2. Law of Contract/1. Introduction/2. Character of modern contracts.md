Modern contracts are legally binding agreements that reflect the principles of fairness, freedom of choice, and certainty in transactions. Over time, contracts have evolved from rigid, formal arrangements to flexible, intent-based agreements, adapting to economic, social, and technological changes. Under the **Contract Act, 1872**, modern contracts balance **party autonomy** with **legal protections**, ensuring they remain relevant for both domestic and international commerce, including in the digital sphere.

### **üîë Key Characteristics of Modern Contracts**

---

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Freedom of Contract**

- **Definition:** Parties are generally free to decide the terms, rights, duties, and conditions of their contract.
    
- **Significance:** Encourages trade and allows tailor-made agreements suited to each party‚Äôs needs.
    
- **Limits:** This freedom is not absolute ‚Äî agreements must comply with statutory requirements, public policy, and fairness principles.
    
- **Bangladesh Context:** Freedom is preserved under the Contract Act, but limited by laws such as the Consumer Rights Protection Act, 2009.
    
- **Example:** Two companies can agree on delivery schedules and payment terms, but cannot contract for illegal activities.
    

---

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Consensual Nature (Consensus ad Idem)**

- **Definition:** A valid contract requires a ‚Äúmeeting of the minds‚Äù ‚Äî mutual agreement on the same thing in the same sense.
    
- **Legal Basis:** Sections 10‚Äì13 of the Contract Act emphasize free consent, lawful consideration, and lawful object.
    
- **Modern Approach:** Consent must be free from coercion, fraud, misrepresentation, or mistake.
    
- **Example:** If A agrees to buy B‚Äôs horse thinking it is Black Beauty, but B intends to sell White Beauty, no valid contract exists.
    
- **Case:** _Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. (1893)_ illustrates clear intent and acceptance through conduct.

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Legally Enforceable Promise**

- **Definition:** Contracts must create legal obligations; social or domestic promises are not enforceable unless intended to be legally binding.
    
- **Example:** A written business agreement is enforceable; inviting a friend to dinner is not.
    

---

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Certainty and Clarity of Terms**

- **Definition:** Terms must be specific and unambiguous; vague agreements are void.
    
- **Example:** ‚ÄúSell you some goods someday‚Äù is uncertain, but ‚Äú100 bags of rice at Tk. 50,000, delivery by 30 August‚Äù is certain.
    

---

#### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Lawful Object and Consideration**

- **Requirement:** The contract‚Äôs purpose and consideration must be legal and not immoral or opposed to public policy.
    
- **Example:** Selling prohibited drugs is void; paying for lawful consultancy is valid.
    

---

#### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Flexibility and Diversity in Form**

- **Scope:** Modern contracts cover sale, lease, employment, construction, and digital transactions.
    
- **Forms:**
    
    - **Standard-form contracts** ‚Äî common in consumer services, scrutinized for fairness.
        
    - **Electronic contracts** ‚Äî recognized under the ICT Act, 2006 (amended 2013), including e-signatures.
        
    - **Unilateral & bilateral contracts** ‚Äî from reward offers to mutual promises.
        
- **Example:** Clicking ‚ÄúI Agree‚Äù online forms a valid e-contract if consent is free and terms are clear.

#### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Protection of Weaker Parties**

- **Mechanisms:**
    
    - **Undue Influence (s.16)** ‚Äî prevents abuse of dominant position.
        
    - **Fraud & Misrepresentation (ss.17‚Äì18)** ‚Äî allow rescission if consent is improperly obtained.
        
    - **Unconscionability** ‚Äî courts can strike down grossly unfair terms.
        
- **Example:** A bank cannot enforce a loan obtained by coercion or hidden clauses.
    

---

#### **8Ô∏è‚É£ Enforceability and Remedies**

- **Definition:** Valid contracts are enforceable through remedies like damages (ss.73‚Äì75) or specific performance.
    
- **Example:** A supplier failing to deliver can be sued for damages.
    
- **Bangladesh Context:** Specific performance is common in land and property contracts.
    

---

#### **9Ô∏è‚É£ Global and Commercial Orientation**

- **Context:** Many contracts now involve cross-border transactions influenced by globalization.
    
- **Example:** A Bangladeshi garment exporter contracts with a European buyer under mutually agreed delivery and payment terms.
