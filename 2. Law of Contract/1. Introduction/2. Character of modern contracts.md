### üìå 1.2 Character of modern contracts ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: This topic is crucial for understanding the practical application of contract law in today's world. The classical model of a negotiated bargain between two equals is now the exception rather than the rule. Understanding the nature of modern standard form contracts and the legal issues they raise is essential for any contemporary legal analysis.

The character of modern contracts has significantly departed from the classical 19th-century model. While the foundational principles remain, their application has been adapted to address the economic realities of the 21st century, which are primarily defined by mass production, consumerism, and digital transactions.

The defining feature of modern contracting is the prevalence of the **Standard Form Contract (SFC)**.

#### üü° What are Standard Form Contracts?

Also known as "contracts of adhesion" or "boilerplate contracts," these are agreements where the terms are pre-drafted by one party (usually a business with significant market power) and offered to the other party (usually a consumer) on a **"take-it-or-leave-it" basis**. There is no room for negotiation.

Think about the last time you:

- Installed a new app on your phone üì±
    
- Opened a bank account üè¶
    
- Booked a flight online ‚úàÔ∏è
    
- Signed up for a mobile phone plan üìû
    

In each case, you agreed to a lengthy set of terms and conditions without reading them, let alone negotiating them. This is the reality of modern contracting.

#### üü° Key Characteristics and Tensions

1. **Efficiency vs. Consent**: SFCs are incredibly efficient. They standardize transactions, reduce costs, and create certainty for businesses. Imagine the impossibility of a company like Grameenphone negotiating unique terms with each of its millions of subscribers. However, this efficiency comes at the cost of genuine consent. The traditional legal idea of a _consensus ad idem_ (a meeting of the minds) is largely a fiction in this context.
    
2. **Unequal Bargaining Power**: Modern contracts are often between parties of vastly different economic strength and legal knowledge. A multinational corporation has a team of lawyers draft its terms, while the consumer has little choice but to accept them if they want the goods or services.
    
3. **Exclusion and Limitation Clauses**: Businesses often use SFCs to include terms that limit or exclude their liability for breach of contract or negligence. These clauses can be buried in fine print and can severely disadvantage the weaker party.
    

#### üü° Legal Responses to the Modern Contract

The potential for injustice inherent in SFCs has forced courts and legislatures to move away from a purely hands-off, _laissez-faire_ approach. The goal of modern contract law is to balance the efficiency of standard forms with the need to protect the weaker party from exploitation. Key regulatory mechanisms include:

- **Judicial Controls**: Courts have developed interpretive rules to mitigate the harshness of SFCs.
    
    - **The _Contra Proferentem_ Rule**: If a clause is ambiguous, it will be interpreted narrowly and against the interests of the party who drafted it.
        
    - **Doctrine of Reasonable Notice**: For an unusually harsh or onerous term to be considered part of the contract, the party seeking to rely on it must show they took extra steps to bring it to the other party's attention. The more unreasonable the clause, the greater the notice required.
        
- **Legislative Controls**: Parliaments around the world have enacted statutes to regulate unfair terms. In Bangladesh, while there isn't a single, comprehensive piece of legislation like the UK's Unfair Contract Terms Act, consumer protection is addressed through laws like the **Consumer Rights Protection Act, 2009**. This Act aims to prevent unfair trade practices and protect consumer interests, which indirectly polices the substance of consumer contracts.
    

In summary, the character of the modern contract is paradoxical. It is, on one hand, a tool of mass-market efficiency and, on the other, a potential instrument of oppression. Consequently, the law has evolved from a simple enforcer of private agreements to a regulator that scrutinizes the substance of the bargain for fairness.
