## üìë **1.3 Principles of Contract** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
> **Importance:** This subtopic is highly important as it outlines the foundational rules and doctrines that underpin all aspects of contract law, directly connecting to the essential elements, formation, and enforcement covered in the syllabus. It's crucial for exam analysis and application (e.g., in Course Learning Outcomes 1 and 4), though not the absolute maximum priority since practical topics like breach remedies may weigh more in assessments.

### **üìå Introduction**

The principles of contract refer to the core doctrines and rules that guide the creation, interpretation, performance, and enforcement of contracts. In Bangladesh, these principles are primarily enshrined in the **Contract Act, 1872**, which is based on English common law but adapted for local contexts. They ensure contracts are fair, predictable, and enforceable, promoting trust in personal, commercial, and social transactions. These principles emphasize mutual agreement, equity, and legal validity, evolving from historical roots to address modern needs like globalization and digital dealings.

### **üîë Key Principles of Contract**

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Pacta Sunt Servanda (Agreements Must Be Kept)**

- **Definition:** This foundational principle means that valid contracts are binding and must be honored by the parties involved.
- **Legal Basis:** Section 1 of the Contract Act, 1872, implies this by defining contracts as enforceable agreements, ensuring parties cannot unilaterally withdraw without consequences.
- **Significance:** It promotes stability in dealings; breaches lead to remedies like damages or specific performance.
- **Example:** If a seller agrees to deliver goods for payment, both must fulfill their obligations, or the aggrieved party can seek court enforcement.
- **Bangladesh Context:** Upheld in commercial contracts, such as export agreements in the garment industry, where non-performance can result in lawsuits under the 1872 Act.
- **Limitations:** Does not apply to void or illegal contracts (e.g., those against public policy under Section 23).

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Freedom of Contract**

- **Definition:** Parties have the liberty to enter into contracts on their own terms, choosing what, with whom, and how to agree.
- **Legal Basis:** Implicit in Section 10 of the Contract Act, 1872, which requires only lawful agreement, consideration, and consent for validity.
- **Significance:** Encourages economic efficiency and personal autonomy, allowing customization of terms.
- **Example:** An employer and employee can negotiate salary and duties freely, as long as they don't violate labor laws.
- **Bangladesh Context:** Balanced by protective laws, such as the Labour Act, 2006, which restricts exploitative terms in employment contracts.
- **Limitations:** Restricted by public policy, morality, or statutes (e.g., no contracts for illegal activities like smuggling).

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Consensus Ad Idem (Meeting of Minds)**

- **Definition:** Parties must have a mutual understanding and agreement on the essential terms of the contract.
- **Legal Basis:** Sections 13 and 29 of the Contract Act, 1872, state that ambiguity or lack of mutual intent can make a contract void.
- **Significance:** Ensures genuine consent, preventing disputes from misunderstandings.
- **Example:** If a buyer thinks they're purchasing a new car but the seller means a used one, there's no consensus, and the contract fails.
- **Bangladesh Context:** Critical in property sales (e.g., land deeds), where courts examine intent to avoid fraud.
- **Related Doctrine:** Free consent (Section 14), free from coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation, or mistake.

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Privity of Contract**

- **Definition:** Only parties to the contract (those in "privity") can enforce its terms or be held liable under it.
- **Legal Basis:** Derived from common law and implied in the Contract Act, 1872; third parties generally cannot sue or be sued.
- **Significance:** Protects parties from external interference while limiting obligations to agreed participants.
- **Example:** If A contracts with B to deliver goods, C (a third party) cannot enforce delivery unless an exception applies (e.g., beneficiary in trust contracts).
- **Bangladesh Context:** Exceptions include agency (Section 226) or assignment of rights, common in banking where loans are assigned.
- **Limitations:** Modern exceptions like contracts for third-party benefit (e.g., insurance policies) are recognized judicially.

#### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Consideration Must Be Lawful and Sufficient**

- **Definition:** Every contract requires something of value (consideration) exchanged between parties, which must be legal and adequate in the eyes of the law.
- **Legal Basis:** Section 2(d) and Section 25 of the Contract Act, 1872, define consideration as an act, abstinence, or promise; without it, agreements are void (with exceptions like gifts).
- **Significance:** Prevents gratuitous promises from being enforceable, ensuring mutuality.
- **Example:** Paying money for goods is consideration; a promise to give a gift without exchange is not enforceable unless registered.
- **Bangladesh Context:** In family settlements or business deals, courts assess if consideration is real (not illusory) and lawful.
- **Limitations:** Need not be adequate (e.g., selling a car for Tk. 1 is valid if intentional), but must not be unlawful (Section 23).

#### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Good Faith and Fair Dealing**

- **Definition:** Parties must act honestly and fairly in forming and performing contracts, avoiding deceit.
- **Legal Basis:** Though not explicitly stated, it's implied in Sections 17-19 (fraud, misrepresentation) and judicial interpretations.
- **Significance:** Builds trust, especially in long-term contracts; breaches can void agreements.
- **Example:** A seller must disclose known defects in goods; hiding them constitutes bad faith.
- **Bangladesh Context:** Emphasized in consumer contracts under the Consumer Rights Protection Act, 2009, and in Islamic finance principles influencing some agreements.
- **Modern Trend:** Increasingly recognized in international contracts affecting Bangladesh's trade.

#### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Equality and Non-Discrimination**

- **Definition:** Contracts should not exploit power imbalances; parties are presumed equal unless proven otherwise.
- **Legal Basis:** Protected through doctrines like undue influence (Section 16) and coercion (Section 15).
- **Significance:** Safeguards vulnerable groups, ensuring voluntary participation.
- **Example:** A contract signed under pressure from a dominant party (e.g., employer vs. employee) may be voidable.
- **Bangladesh Context:** Relevant in rural lending or labor contracts, where courts intervene to prevent usury or exploitation.

### ‚úÖ **Key Takeaways**

‚úî **Binding Agreements:** Principles like pacta sunt servanda and privity ensure enforceability among parties only.  
‚úî **Mutual Intent and Fairness:** Consensus ad idem and good faith emphasize genuine, honest agreements.  
‚úî **Balanced Freedom:** Autonomy is key but limited by lawfulness, consideration, and protections against inequality.  
‚úî **Application in Bangladesh:** Rooted in the Contract Act, 1872, these principles adapt to local commerce, consumer rights, and judicial precedents.  
‚úî **For Exams:** Link principles to sections of the Act; use examples to illustrate how they validate or invalidate contracts, preparing for analytical questions on nature and formation.
