## 📌 1.1 History and development ⭐⭐

>**Why Not as Critical**: This subtopic is primarily historical and provides context rather than black-letter law. While understanding the evolution of contract law deepens your appreciation of the subject, it is not frequently the focus of direct, problem-based examination questions, which tend to concentrate on the application of current legal rules.

The history of contract law is a fascinating journey that mirrors the socio-economic development of society itself, chronicling a fundamental shift from a world governed by status to one governed by individual will and agreement.

#### 🟡 From Status to Contract

In early medieval England, a person's rights and obligations were largely determined by their **status** within the rigid feudal hierarchy (e.g., a serf's obligations to their lord). There was no overarching concept of enforcing a simple promise. The early common law only recognized specific, formal types of actions, such as:

- **Writ of Covenant**: To enforce promises made under a formal seal (a deed).
    
- **Writ of Debt**: To recover a specific sum of money owed for goods or services already delivered.
    

These writs were highly rigid and inadequate for the growing needs of commerce, as they did not cover informal, executory agreements (where promises were yet to be performed on both sides).

#### 🟡 The Rise of _Assumpsit_

The turning point was the development of a legal action known as the **writ of _assumpsit_** (from the Latin, meaning "he undertook" or "he promised"). Crucially, _assumpsit_ originated not in contract, but in the law of torts (civil wrongs).

Initially, it was used for **misfeasance**: when a person undertook a task and performed it negligently, causing harm. A classic example is the _Humber Ferryman_ case (1348), where a ferryman overloaded his boat, causing the plaintiff's horse to be lost. The court held the ferryman liable for his negligent performance of the undertaking.

The major conceptual leap occurred when courts began to allow _assumpsit_ for **non-feasance**: the complete failure to perform a promise. This extension transformed the action from one based on a wrongful act to one based on a failure to honour a promise. To prevent the floodgates from opening for every broken promise, the courts developed a crucial limiting device: the **doctrine of consideration**. To enforce a promise through _assumpsit_, the claimant had to show they had given something of value in return—a bargain had been struck. This established the bargain theory as the core of the common law of contract.

#### 🟡 The Classical Era and Codification in the Subcontinent

The 19th century was the golden age of **classical contract theory**. Influenced by the Industrial Revolution and the philosophy of _laissez-faire_, the law championed the principles of **freedom of contract** and **sanctity of contract**. The prevailing view was that parties should be free to make their own bargains, and the courts should enforce those bargains without questioning their fairness.

In **British India**, the need for a uniform set of rules to govern the burgeoning trade and commerce led to a process of codification. The English common law principles of contract, developed through cases over centuries, were systematically organized and enacted as the **Contract Act, 1872**. This Act, which applies in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan, is a testament to the influence of the English legal system.

#### 🟡 Modern Developments

The 20th and 21st centuries have seen a retreat from the strict _laissez-faire_ approach. Courts and legislatures recognized that absolute freedom of contract could lead to injustice, particularly in cases of **unequal bargaining power**. The rise of the **standard form contract** (non-negotiable, "take-it-or-leave-it" contracts) meant that the idea of a "meeting of the minds" was often a legal fiction.

Consequently, modern contract law incorporates numerous protections for weaker parties through:

- Statutory regulations (e.g., consumer protection laws).
    
- Judicial doctrines like unconscionability and duress.
    
- The implication of terms into contracts to ensure fairness.
    

In essence, the development of contract law shows a move from a rigid, formalistic system to a flexible one based on promises, then to a period of almost absolute individual freedom, and finally to a modern, balanced approach that tempers freedom with principles of fairness and the protection of vulnerable parties.
