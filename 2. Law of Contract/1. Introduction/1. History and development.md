### **üìå Introduction**

The history and development of contract law trace the evolution of rules governing agreements between parties, from ancient civilizations to the codified systems used today. In the context of Bangladesh, contract law is primarily based on the Contract Act, 1872 (inherited from British colonial rule), which draws heavily from English common law principles. Understanding this history helps explain the shift from rigid formalities to flexible, intent-based contracts, emphasizing fairness, consent, and enforceability in commercial and social dealings.

### **üîë Key Historical Phases**

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Ancient and Early Origins**

- Contract law has roots in ancient societies where agreements were often informal or based on customs.
- **Babylonian and Roman Influence:** Around 1750 BCE, the Code of Hammurabi in Babylon included basic rules for trade and loans. Roman law (from 450 BCE onward) developed more structured concepts like "pacta sunt servanda" (agreements must be kept), classifying contracts into types such as verbal, written, and real (requiring delivery of goods).
- These early systems focused on formalities (e.g., seals or witnesses) rather than mere promises, influencing later European laws.

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Medieval England and Common Law Development**

- In medieval England (11th-15th centuries), contract enforcement was limited to specific "writs" (court orders) under common law:
  - **Writ of Debt:** For recovering fixed sums, like loans.
  - **Writ of Covenant:** For agreements under seal (formal written documents).
  - **Writ of Detinue:** For return of goods.
- These were rigid and did not cover informal promises, leading to gaps in justice.
- **Rise of Assumpsit (16th Century):** A major development; the action of "assumpsit" (meaning "he undertook") allowed courts to enforce informal promises if there was a detriment or benefit (early form of consideration). This shifted focus from form to substance.
- Key Case: *Slade's Case (1602)* ‚Äì Unified debt and assumpsit, laying the foundation for modern contract law by recognizing enforceable promises based on mutual agreement.

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Industrial Revolution and 19th Century Reforms**

- The 18th-19th centuries saw rapid growth due to industrialization and trade in England, demanding clearer rules for commercial contracts.
- Principles like freedom of contract emerged, assuming parties were equal and could bargain freely (laissez-faire approach).
- Landmark Developments:
  - **Statute of Frauds (1677):** Required certain contracts (e.g., land sales) to be in writing to prevent fraud.
  - Key Cases: *Hadley v Baxendale (1854)* ‚Äì Established rules for damages in breach.
  - *Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. (1893)* ‚Äì Highlighted unilateral contracts and offer-acceptance in advertisements.
- This era codified principles of offer, acceptance, consideration, and intention, forming the backbone of English contract law.

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Colonial Influence and Development in the Indian Subcontinent (Including Bangladesh)**

- British colonial rule introduced English common law to India (which included present-day Bangladesh) via the East India Company.
- **Early Period (17th-18th Centuries):** Local customs (Hindu and Muslim laws) coexisted with English principles for Europeans; contracts were enforced through Mayor's Courts in presidency towns.
- **Codification (19th Century):** To unify diverse laws, the Indian Contract Act, 1872 was enacted by the British Indian government, based on English law but simplified for local use. It was drafted by the Third Law Commission (influenced by jurists like Sir James Fitzjames Stephen).
  - Key Features: Covered formation, performance, and remedies; applied to all of India (now Bangladesh, India, Pakistan).
- **Post-Independence in Bangladesh:** After 1947 partition and 1971 independence, Bangladesh retained the 1872 Act with minor amendments (e.g., via the Contract (Amendment) Act, 2006 for electronic contracts). It blends common law with statutory provisions, adapting to modern needs like e-commerce while preserving historical roots.

#### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Modern Developments (20th-21st Centuries)**

- Globally, contract law evolved to address inequalities, with doctrines like undue influence and unconscionability protecting weaker parties.
- In Bangladesh: Influenced by globalization, additions include the Competition Act, 2012 (for anti-competitive agreements) and alignment with international standards (e.g., UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, though not fully ratified).
- Recent Trends: Emphasis on good faith, consumer protection (e.g., Consumer Rights Protection Act, 2009), and digital contracts, reflecting societal changes.
