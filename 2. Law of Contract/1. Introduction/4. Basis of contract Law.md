## 📑 **1.4 Basis of Contract Law**

---

### **Introduction**

The basis of contract law explains _why_ certain agreements are legally binding and enforceable. It focuses on the core idea that when people voluntarily enter into agreements, the law recognizes their promises as obligations, provided legal requirements are met.

---

### **1️⃣ Promises and Agreements**

- The law of contract is based on the principle that promises, if made with free consent and proper consideration, must be honored.
    
- Not every promise is legally binding — only those creating legal obligations.
    

**Example:**  
A promise to gift someone a car without any consideration is not enforceable. But promising to sell a car for money creates enforceable duties.

---

### **2️⃣ Consensus ad Idem (Meeting of Minds)**

- Contract law relies on mutual agreement.
    
- Parties must agree on the same thing in the same sense (consensus ad idem).
    
- Without true agreement, there is no contract.
    

**Example:**  
If A intends to sell his bike and B thinks he is buying A’s car, there is no consensus — so no valid contract.

---

### **3️⃣ Enforceability by Law**

- A contract differs from a mere agreement because it is enforceable by law.
    
- Section 2(h) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 defines a contract as _“an agreement enforceable by law.”_
    

**Example:**  
A social promise to attend a friend’s wedding cannot be enforced in court. But an agreement to deliver goods for payment is enforceable.

---

### **4️⃣ Consideration**

- Consideration is something of value given in return for a promise.
    
- The concept is: “No consideration, no contract” (Section 25).
    
- Consideration distinguishes social promises from legally binding ones.
    

**Example:**  
A pays B Tk. 1 lakh to paint his house — B’s promise to paint is supported by consideration (money).

---

### **5️⃣ Freedom of Contract**

- The basis of modern contract law is that people are free to decide terms, provided they don’t break the law or public policy.
    
- Courts usually do not interfere with freely negotiated terms.
    

**Example:**  
Two companies can agree on price, delivery, or penalties as they wish — the court will only check legality and fairness.

---

### **6️⃣ Sanctity of Contract**

- This means the law respects valid contracts and ensures parties perform their promises.
    
- This promotes trust in commercial and personal dealings.
    

**Example:**  
If a seller refuses to deliver paid goods, the buyer can sue to enforce the contract.

---

### **7️⃣ Good Faith and Fair Dealing**

- While not always explicitly stated, fairness, honesty, and good faith are basic expectations in contract performance.
    
- Courts may void unfair or unconscionable contracts.
    

**Example:**  
If a powerful party uses unfair terms to exploit a weaker party, courts may declare it void or modify the terms.

---

### **Conclusion**

In short, the basis of contract law is the recognition and protection of voluntary promises that create legally enforceable duties. It promotes economic activity, trust, and certainty in society.
