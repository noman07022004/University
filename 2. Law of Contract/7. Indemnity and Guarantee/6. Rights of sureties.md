Of course. Let's cover the final subtopic in this section.

### **7.6 Rights of sureties** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Why Important**: A surety undertakes a significant financial risk. The law, therefore, provides them with a comprehensive set of rights to protect their position and to ensure they can recover the amount they have paid. Without these rights, the position of a surety would be unfairly burdensome, and the entire system of guarantees would be unworkable.

The rights of a surety can be categorized based on whom they are exercised against: the principal debtor, the creditor, and any co-sureties.

#### **1. Rights Against the Principal Debtor**

Once a surety has paid the debt to the creditor, they acquire two key rights against the person who was primarily liable:

- **Right of Subrogation (Section 140)**: This is the right to "step into the shoes of the creditor." Upon payment, the surety is invested with all the rights the creditor had against the principal debtor. If the creditor held any securities (like a mortgage or a lien), the surety is now entitled to the benefit of those securities. üëû
    
- **Right of Indemnity (Section 145)**: In every contract of guarantee, there is an implied promise by the principal debtor to indemnify the surety. This means the surety has the right to recover from the debtor not only the principal sum they paid but also any interest and costs incurred.

#### **2. Rights Against the Creditor**

The surety has important rights against the creditor even before payment:

- **Right to Securities (Section 141)**: The surety is entitled to the benefit of every security that the creditor holds against the principal debtor at the time the guarantee is made. If the creditor loses or gives up any of these securities without the surety's consent, the surety's liability is **discharged to the extent of the value of the security lost**.
    
    - **Example**: A bank gives a loan of BDT 100,000, which is secured by the debtor's shares worth BDT 30,000 and guaranteed by a surety. The bank, without the surety's consent, returns the shares to the debtor. If the debtor defaults, the surety is only liable for BDT 70,000, as their liability is reduced by the value of the security that was lost.

#### **3. Rights Against Co-sureties**

When multiple people act as sureties for the same debt, they are called co-sureties.

- **Right to Contribution (Section 146)**: Co-sureties are liable to contribute equally to the debt (unless they have agreed otherwise). If one co-surety is forced to pay more than their proportionate share, they have the right to demand contribution from the other co-sureties.
    
    - **Example**: X, Y, and Z are co-sureties for a debt of BDT 90,000. The debtor defaults. X is compelled to pay the entire amount. X is entitled to recover BDT 30,000 from Y and BDT 30,000 from Z. This right exists even if the sureties were not aware of each other.
