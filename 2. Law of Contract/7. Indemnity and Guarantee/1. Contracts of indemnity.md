Of course. Let's start with the first of these special contracts.

### **7.1 Contracts of indemnity** ⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This topic defines a fundamental risk-shifting contract. As the basis of almost all insurance contracts, understanding its mechanics is crucial for grasping how businesses and individuals legally protect themselves from potential financial loss.

A **contract of indemnity** is a promise to save a person from the financial consequences of a certain event. It is a contract to make good a loss.

The definition is provided in **Section 124 of the Contract Act, 1872**:

> _"A contract by which one party promises to save the other from loss caused to him by the conduct of the promisor himself, or by the conduct of any other person, is called a 'contract of indemnity'."_

#### **Parties and Essentials**

There are two parties to this contract:

1. **The Indemnifier**: The person who promises to pay for the loss.
    
2. **The Indemnity-Holder**: The person who is protected against the loss.
    

The liability of the indemnifier is **primary and direct**. It does not depend on the default of a third party.

**Example**: A asks B to deliver certain goods to him, but C is also claiming ownership of the goods. A promises to **indemnify** B against any loss if B delivers the goods to him and C later successfully sues B. This is a contract of indemnity. A is the indemnifier, and B is the indemnity-holder.

#### **Scope and Judicial Interpretation**

The definition in Section 124 is quite narrow, as it technically only covers losses caused by **human conduct**. It does not seem to include losses from accidents like fires or floods.

However, the courts in Bangladesh and India have applied a much broader, equitable interpretation based on English common law. They treat **all contracts of insurance** (e.g., fire, marine, accident) as contracts of indemnity. Therefore, in practice, a contract of indemnity is understood to be a promise to save another from loss caused by a specified event, whether man-made or accidental.

#### **Rights of the Indemnity-Holder (Section 125)**

When the indemnity-holder is sued for a matter covered by the indemnity, they have the right to recover the following from the indemnifier:

- **All damages** they are forced to pay.
    
- **All legal costs** they incur in defending the lawsuit.
    
- **All sums** they pay as part of a reasonable compromise or settlement.
    

Crucially, the modern judicial view is that the indemnity-holder can compel the indemnifier to pay the liability **as soon as it arises**, without waiting to pay the loss out of their own pocket first.
