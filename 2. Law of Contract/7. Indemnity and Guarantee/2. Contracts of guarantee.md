### **7.2 Contracts of guarantee** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: The contract of guarantee is a cornerstone of commercial and banking law. It is the primary legal tool used to secure loans and ensure performance in a vast range of transactions. Understanding the roles and liabilities of the three parties involved is essential for anyone dealing with credit, finance, or commercial agreements.

A **contract of guarantee** is a promise to perform the promise, or discharge the liability, of a third person in case of their default. It's an undertaking to be answerable for someone else's debt or obligation.

The definition is provided in **Section 126 of the Contract Act, 1872**.

#### **Parties and Essentials**

Unlike an indemnity, a contract of guarantee involves **three parties** and three separate agreements.

1. **The Principal Debtor**: The person who is primarily liable for the debt or obligation.
    
2. **The Creditor**: The person to whom the guarantee is given.
    
3. **The Surety (or Guarantor)**: The person who gives the guarantee and promises to pay if the principal debtor defaults.
    

The liability of the surety is **secondary and conditional**. It only activates **if and when** the principal debtor fails to perform their obligation.

**Example**

- **Scenario**: A wants to take a loan of BDT 100,000 from the Bank. The Bank is not confident in A's ability to repay and asks for a guarantor. A's friend, B, agrees to act as a guarantor.
    
- **Analysis**:
    
    - **A** is the **Principal Debtor**.
        
    - The **Bank** is the **Creditor**.
        
    - **B** is the **Surety**.
        
    - B's promise to the Bank is the contract of guarantee. The Bank can only demand payment from B if A defaults on the loan repayment.

#### **Essential Features**

- **A Principal Debt**: There must be an existing or future legally enforceable debt owed by the principal debtor. If there is no principal debt, there can be no guarantee.
    
- **Consideration**: Like any contract, a guarantee must have consideration. However, **Section 127** states that anything done, or any promise made, for the benefit of the principal debtor can be sufficient consideration for the surety. The act of the bank giving the loan to A is the consideration for B's promise to guarantee it.
    
- **Not necessarily in writing**: A contract of guarantee can be oral or written.
    
- **No Misrepresentation**: The guarantee must not be obtained by misrepresenting or concealing material facts from the surety. If it is, the guarantee is invalid (**Sections 142 & 143**).
