Of course. Let's proceed to the next main topic.

## **7. Indemnity and Guarantee** ⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: These are specialized but very common types of commercial contracts designed to manage risk and provide security. Contracts of guarantee are fundamental to the banking and lending industries (e.g., for securing loans), while indemnity is the basis of insurance. Understanding the precise rights and liabilities of the parties is crucial for commercial practice.

This topic deals with contracts where one person promises to protect another from loss. While they seem similar, the law draws a clear distinction between a contract of indemnity and a contract of guarantee.

### **Contracts of Indemnity**

A **contract of indemnity** is defined in **Section 124 of the Contract Act, 1872**. It is a two-party contract where one person (the **indemnifier**) promises to save the other (the **indemnity-holder**) from a loss caused to them. The key feature is that the loss can be caused either by the conduct of the indemnifier themselves or by the conduct of any other person.

- **Parties**: 2 (Indemnifier, Indemnity-holder)
    
- **Purpose**: To reimburse for a loss.
    
- **Liability**: The indemnifier's liability is **primary and direct**.
    
- **Classic Example**: A **contract of insurance**. An insurance company (indemnifier) promises to pay you (indemnity-holder) for the loss if your car is damaged in an accident. The promise is to make good your loss.
    

### **Contracts of Guarantee**

A **contract of guarantee** is defined in **Section 126**. It is a three-party contract to perform the promise, or discharge the liability, of a third person in case of their default.

- **Parties**: 3 (Principal Debtor, Creditor, Surety/Guarantor)
    
    - **Principal Debtor**: The person who has the primary liability (e.g., the borrower of a loan).
        
    - **Creditor**: The person to whom the promise is made (e.g., the bank).
        
    - **Surety**: The person who gives the guarantee.
        
- **Purpose**: To provide security for a debt or promise.
    
- **Liability**: The surety's liability is **secondary and conditional**. It only arises if the principal debtor defaults.
    
- **Classic Example**: A **bank loan**. A (principal debtor) takes a loan from the Bank (creditor). B (surety) promises the bank that if A fails to repay the loan, B will pay it.

### **Surety's Liability and Rights**

The **extent of a surety's liability** is co-extensive with that of the principal debtor. This means the surety is liable for the whole amount for which the principal debtor is liable, including interest and costs, unless the contract states otherwise.

A **continuing guarantee** is one that extends to a series of transactions (e.g., guaranteeing a running account at a bank). It can be revoked by the surety at any time for future transactions.

The law also grants several important **rights to sureties** to protect them. After the surety pays the debt, they have the right to:

1. **Step into the shoes of the creditor** (Right of Subrogation) and recover the money from the principal debtor.
    
2. **Claim indemnity** from the principal debtor for the amount they have rightfully paid.
    
3. **Claim contribution** from any co-sureties if they have paid more than their share.
