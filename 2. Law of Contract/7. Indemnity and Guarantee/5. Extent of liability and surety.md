Of course. Let's cover the next subtopic.

### **7.5 Extent of liability and surety** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This topic defines the scope and limit of the surety's financial responsibility. The principle of co-extensive liability is the default rule for all contracts of guarantee and is fundamental to determining exactly what a creditor can claim from the surety upon the principal debtor's default.

The central rule governing the extent of a surety's liability is laid down in **Section 128 of the Contract Act, 1872**.

#### **The Principle of Co-extensive Liability**

Section 128 states:

> _"The liability of the surety is co-extensive with that of the principal debtor, unless it is otherwise provided by the contract."_

This means the surety's liability **mirrors** the liability of the principal debtor. The surety is liable for the whole amount that the principal debtor is liable for. This includes not just the principal amount of the debt, but also any accrued **interest**, costs, and other charges.

**Key Points**:

- **Mirror Image**: Whatever the principal debtor owes, the surety owes.
    
- **Maximum Limit**: The surety's liability cannot be more than the principal debtor's liability.
    
- **Can be Limited by Contract**: The parties are free to limit the surety's liability in the guarantee agreement. For example, a surety can guarantee a loan of BDT 500,000 but stipulate that their personal liability is capped at BDT 200,000.
    

**Example**

- **Scenario**: A takes a loan of BDT 100,000 from a bank with an interest rate of 10% per annum, and B acts as the surety. A defaults on the loan after one year.
    
- **Liability**: At the time of default, A (the principal debtor) owes the bank BDT 110,000 (BDT 100,000 principal + BDT 10,000 interest).
    
- **Surety's Extent of Liability**: Because the surety's liability is co-extensive, B (the surety) is also liable to the bank for the full BDT 110,000.
    

#### **When Does the Surety's Liability Arise?**

The creditor can sue the surety **directly** as soon as the principal debtor defaults. The creditor is **not** required to first exhaust all legal remedies against the principal debtor. They don't have to sue the debtor first or try to sell the debtor's property before they can demand payment from the surety. The surety's obligation arises immediately upon the debtor's default.
