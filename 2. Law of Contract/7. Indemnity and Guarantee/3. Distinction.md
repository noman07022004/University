### **7.3 Distinction** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: The distinction between a contract of indemnity and a contract of guarantee is a classic and frequently tested topic. While both involve one party promising to cover a loss, their legal structure, the nature of the liability, and the number of parties involved are fundamentally different. Getting this distinction right is crucial for legal analysis.

Here is a direct comparison of the key differences:

|Basis of Distinction|Contract of Indemnity|Contract of Guarantee|
|---|---|---|
|**Parties**|There are **two** parties: the Indemnifier and the Indemnity-holder.|There are **three** parties: the Principal Debtor, the Creditor, and the Surety.|
|**Nature of Liability**|The liability of the indemnifier is **primary and direct**.|The liability of the surety is **secondary and conditional**. It only arises upon the default of the Principal Debtor.|
|**Purpose**|The purpose is to **reimburse for a loss**. It is a contract for protection.|The purpose is to provide **security for a debt** or promise. It makes a debt safer for the creditor.|
|**Number of Contracts**|There is only **one** contract, between the indemnifier and the indemnity-holder.|There are **three** contracts: (1) between the Creditor and Principal Debtor, (2) between the Creditor and Surety, and (3) an implied contract between the Surety and Principal Debtor.|
|**Triggering Event**|The liability arises when the indemnity-holder suffers the specified loss.|The liability arises only when the principal debtor **defaults**.|
|**Example**|An **insurance contract**. The insurer's promise to pay for a burnt house is direct and primary.|A **bank loan guarantor**. The guarantor's promise to pay is secondary to the borrower's primary promise.|
