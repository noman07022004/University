Of course. Let's cover the next subtopic.

### **7.4 Continuing guarantee** ⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This is a very common type of guarantee used in business and banking to secure ongoing credit facilities, like overdraft accounts or credit extended to suppliers. Understanding how it works and, crucially, how it can be revoked, is essential for commercial practice.

A **continuing guarantee** is not a guarantee for a single transaction; it is a guarantee that extends to a **series of transactions** over a period of time.

The definition is given in **Section 129 of the Contract Act, 1872**:

> _"A guarantee which extends to a series of transactions is called a 'continuing guarantee'."_

#### **How it Works**

The surety's liability in a continuing guarantee keeps extending to each new transaction as it occurs until the guarantee is revoked.

**Example**:

- **Scenario**: S gives a guarantee to C for any groceries C sells to P on credit, up to a maximum amount of BDT 10,000.
    
- **Transactions**:
    
    - C sells P groceries worth BDT 2,000. S is liable for BDT 2,000 if P defaults.
        
    - P pays off the BDT 2,000.
        
    - C then sells P more groceries worth BDT 5,000.
        
- **Outcome**: The guarantee is still active. It "continues" to cover the new transaction. S is now liable for BDT 5,000 if P defaults. This will continue for every transaction until the BDT 10,000 limit is reached or the guarantee is revoked.

#### **Revocation of a Continuing Guarantee**

A key feature of a continuing guarantee is that the surety can limit their future liability by revoking it.

**1. By Notice (Section 130)** The surety can revoke the continuing guarantee at any time by giving **notice** to the creditor.

- **Important**: The revocation only applies to **future transactions**. The surety remains liable for all transactions that have already taken place before the notice was given.
    

**2. By Death of the Surety (Section 131)** Unless the contract says otherwise, the death of the surety automatically revokes the continuing guarantee for all future transactions. The surety's estate is not liable for any transactions entered into between the creditor and the principal debtor after the surety's death, even if the creditor has no notice of the death.
