Of course. Let's cover the crucial restrictions on a Muslim will.

### 12.2 Restrictions ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: The restrictions on a `Wasiyat` are the most defining and critical feature of the Muslim law of wills. They represent the core legal principle of protecting the superior rights of the Qur'anic heirs over the testator's freedom of disposition. These two cardinal limitations are fundamental, strictly applied, and an essential, exam-heavy topic.

#### Detailed Explanation

A Muslim's freedom to dispose of their property by will is not absolute. It is subject to two powerful and fundamental restrictions that are designed to protect the integrity of the Islamic law of inheritance.

### **1. The Restriction on the Amount (The Bequeathable Third)**

- **The Rule**: A Muslim can only bequeath a maximum of **one-third (1/3)** of the net value of their estate. The "net estate" is the property that remains after the payment of the testator's reasonable funeral expenses and all of their debts. The remaining two-thirds of the property is the unalienable right of the legal heirs and must be distributed according to the fixed shares of inheritance.
    
- **Basis**: This rule is based on a direct and authoritative Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).
    
- **The Role of Heirs' Consent**: A bequest that exceeds the one-third limit is not automatically void. It is considered **invalid or inoperative** unless the **legal heirs, after the death of the testator, give their consent** to the excess amount. If they consent, the bequest is valid. If they do not, the bequest is only valid up to the one-third limit, and the rest fails.

### **2. The Restriction on the Recipient (The Prohibition on Bequeathing to an Heir)**

- **The Rule**: A bequest in favor of any person who is entitled to inherit from the testator as a **legal heir** is **invalid**.
    
- **Basis**: This is also based on a direct Prophetic Hadith which states, "Verily, Allah has given to every one his due right, therefore, there is no bequest for an heir."
    
- **Rationale**: The purpose of this rule is to prevent a testator from unfairly favoring one heir over others, which would disrupt the carefully balanced shares of inheritance prescribed in the Qur'an. Since an heir is already guaranteed a share by law, they cannot receive an additional share through a will at the expense of other heirs.
    
- **The Role of Heirs' Consent**: Similar to the first restriction, this rule can be waived. A bequest made to one heir can become **valid** if all the **other legal heirs give their free consent** to it after the death of the testator. The consent of the other heirs is essentially a waiver of their own rights in favor of the heir who is the beneficiary of the will.
    

These two restrictions ensure that a will acts as a complementary tool to the law of inheritance, not as a means to subvert it.
