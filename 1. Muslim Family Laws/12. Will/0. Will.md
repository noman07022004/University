## üìå Will ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: The law of Wills, or **`Wasiyat`**, is a crucial part of Muslim personal law that governs the transfer of property after a person's death. It is fundamentally important because it represents the limited power a Muslim has to dispose of their property outside the rigid framework of the Qur'anic laws of inheritance. The strict restrictions on this power are a key feature of the legal system, designed to protect the rights of legal heirs.

---

A **Will (`Wasiyat`)** is a legal declaration made by a person (the **testator** or `musi`) concerning the disposition of their property or affairs, which is intended to take effect after their death.

- **Distinction from a Gift (`Hiba`)**: A `Hiba` is an immediate transfer of property between living people and is complete upon delivery of possession. A `Wasiyat`, by contrast, is a **post-mortem disposition**; it has no legal effect until the testator dies.
    
- **Purpose**: The primary purpose of a will in Islamic law is to allow a person a limited degree of freedom to make bequests for charitable purposes or to benefit individuals who are not their legal heirs (e.g., a poor friend, an orphaned grandchild whose parent is deceased).
    
- **Revocability**: A will is **revocable at any time** by the testator before their death.

### üü¢ Part I: The Cardinal Restrictions on Wills

The power to make a will in Islamic law is not absolute. It is subject to two fundamental restrictions designed to protect the integrity of the Islamic law of inheritance.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ The "Bequeathable Third" Rule

- **The Rule**: A Muslim can only bequeath a maximum of **one-third (1/3)** of their net property through a will. The "net property" is what remains after the payment of the testator's funeral expenses and debts. The remaining two-thirds of the estate must be distributed among the legal heirs as per their fixed Qur'anic shares.
    
- **Consent of Heirs**: A bequest that exceeds the one-third limit is **not void**, but it is **invalid** unless the **legal heirs, whose shares would be reduced, give their consent** after the testator's death.
    

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ The Prohibition on Bequeathing to an Heir

- **The Rule**: A bequest made in favor of a person who is already a **legal heir** is **invalid**. For example, a man with two sons cannot make a will leaving an extra portion of his property to just one of them.
    
- **Rationale**: This rule prevents a testator from altering the fixed shares of inheritance prescribed by the Qur'an and unfairly favoring one heir over another.
    
- **Consent of Heirs**: Similar to the one-third rule, this prohibition can be relaxed. A bequest to an heir becomes **valid** if the **other legal heirs give their consent** after the testator's death.

### üü¢ Part II: Types and Formalities

- **Form of a Will**: A will can be made **orally** or in **writing**. An oral will is perfectly valid, provided its terms can be proven with certainty. No specific form or technical language is required; the testator's intention to make a post-mortem disposition must simply be clear.
    
- **Types of Bequests**: A will can be for the ownership of a property (`wasiyat bil mal`) or for its usufruct (right to use and enjoy) (`wasiyat bil manafi`). It can also be conditional.

### üü¢ Part III: Statutory Provisions in Bangladesh

- **Exemption from the Succession Act, 1925**: The general law that governs the formalities of wills in Bangladesh is The Succession Act, 1925. This Act requires a will to be in writing, signed by the testator, and attested by at least two witnesses. However, the provisions of this Act **do not apply to the wills of Muslims**.
    
- **Effect of Exemption**: This means a Muslim will is governed purely by Muslim Personal Law. An **oral will is valid**, and a written will (`Wasiyatnama`) does **not require attestation by witnesses** to be valid.
    
- **Registration and Probate**:
    
    - **Registration**: A written will can be registered under The Registration Act, 1908. Registration is **not mandatory** for its validity but is highly recommended as it provides strong proof of its authenticity.
        
    - **Probate**: While not legally required for a Muslim will, an executor or legatee can apply to a court for a **probate**, which is the official certification of the will's validity. Probate is often useful for establishing legal title when dealing with formal institutions.
