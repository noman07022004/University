### 12.4 Statutory provisions ⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This topic is important because it clarifies the relationship between Muslim personal law and the general laws of the country regarding wills. It explains the crucial statutory exemption that allows a Muslim will to be valid without the strict formalities of writing and attestation that are required for wills made by people of other communities.

#### Detailed Explanation

The creation and execution of wills in Bangladesh are generally governed by **The Succession Act, 1925**. However, this Act itself contains provisions that create a special exception for wills made by Muslims, meaning they are primarily governed by their own personal law.

**The General Law of Wills**

- **The Succession Act, 1925**: Part VI of this Act lays down the strict formalities for creating a valid will. For a will to be valid under the general law, it **must** be:
    
    1. In **writing**.
        
    2. **Signed** by the testator.
        
    3. **Attested** by at least two witnesses, who must sign the will in the testator's presence.
        
- **Effect**: Under this general law, an oral will is invalid, and a written will without the required attestation is also invalid.
    

**The Exemption for Muslim Wills**

The most important statutory provision is the one that exempts Muslims from these strict rules.

- **The Rule**: The provisions of **Part VI of The Succession Act, 1925, do not apply to the wills of Muslims**.
    
- **Legal Effect**: This means that the validity of a Muslim's will (`Wasiyat`) is determined solely by the principles of **Muslim Personal Law**, not the Succession Act.
    
- **The Consequences of the Exemption**:
    
    - An **oral will** made by a Muslim is perfectly valid.
        
    - A **written will (`Wasiyatnama`)** made by a Muslim does **not** need to be signed or attested by witnesses to be legally valid. The only requirement is that the testator's intention can be clearly proven.
        

**Other Relevant Statutes**

- **The Registration Act, 1908**: The registration of a will is **optional**. A will is not a document that is required to be registered. However, a written will _can_ be registered. Registering a will provides strong evidence of its authenticity and helps to prevent it from being challenged or forged later.
    
- **Probate**: It is **not mandatory** for the executor of a Muslim will to obtain **probate** from a court. Probate is the official court process that certifies a will as authentic. While not required for the will's validity, obtaining probate is often a practical necessity, as formal institutions like banks may require it to transfer the deceased's assets to the executor or legatee.
