Of course. Let's cover the types of wills.

### 12.3 Types ⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This topic is important for understanding the formalities of how a will is created and its different forms. The rules are significant because they are highly flexible, emphasizing the testator's intention over any rigid legal format. This flexibility, especially the validity of an oral will, is a key feature of Muslim personal law.

#### Detailed Explanation

Muslim law is not concerned with strict technical formalities for the creation of a will (`Wasiyat`). The primary consideration is the clear and verifiable intention of the testator. Wills can be classified based on their form (how they are made) and their content.

**1. Types Based on Form**

- **a) Oral Will**:
    
    - **The Rule**: A will made by spoken words is **perfectly valid** under Muslim law. No writing is necessary.
        
    - **Proof**: While legally valid, an oral will can be difficult to prove in court. The burden of proof is on the person who claims the will was made. They must establish the exact terms of the will with a high degree of certainty, usually through the testimony of credible witnesses who heard the testator's declaration.
        
- **b) Written Will (`Wasiyatnama`)**:
    
    - **The Rule**: A will can be made in writing, and this is known as a `Wasiyatnama`.
        
    - **Formalities**: No specific form is required. Under Muslim law, it **does not need to be signed** by the testator or **attested by witnesses** to be valid. The testator's intention is the key factor.
        
    - **Benefit**: A written will provides clear and strong evidence of the testator's wishes and is much easier to prove and enforce than an oral will.
        

**2. Types Based on Content**

- **a) Unconditional Will**: This is the standard form, where a bequest is made without any conditions attached.
    
- **b) Conditional Will**: A testator can make a bequest that is contingent upon a future event, as long as the condition is lawful and not against the principles of Islam. The bequest will only take effect if the condition is fulfilled.
    
    - **Example**: "I bequeath my library to my niece, on the condition that she passes her law exams."
        

**3. Revocation of a Will**

While not a "type" of will, the power of revocation is an inherent characteristic.

- **The Rule**: A will is **revocable at any time** by the testator before their death.
    
- **Methods of Revocation**:
    
    - **Express Revocation**: This can be done orally or in writing, where the testator simply declares that they are cancelling their previous will. Making a new will that is inconsistent with an older one also serves as a revocation of the older will.
        
    - **Implied Revocation**: This happens through the actions of the testator. If the testator sells, gifts, or intentionally destroys the property that they had bequeathed, the will is automatically revoked with respect to that specific property.
