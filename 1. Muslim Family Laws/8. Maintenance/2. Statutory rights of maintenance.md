Of course. Let's cover the statutory framework for enforcing maintenance rights in Bangladesh.

### 8.2 Statutory rights of maintenance ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This topic is of the highest practical importance. While the right to maintenance is granted by classical Islamic law, these statutes provide the **actual legal mechanisms and forums** through which a wife can enforce that right in Bangladesh. Knowing the specific procedures under the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance and the Family Courts Ordinance is essential for any legal practitioner.

#### Detailed Explanation

In Bangladesh, a wife's classical right to maintenance (`Nafaqah`) is strongly supported by a statutory framework that provides two primary legal avenues for her to claim and enforce this right.

### **1. Summary Remedy under The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 (MFLO)**

**Section 9** of the MFLO provides a quick, inexpensive, and summary administrative procedure for claiming maintenance.

- **The Forum**: The **Arbitration Council** (`Salishi Parishad`), which is headed by the local government Chairman (e.g., Union Parishad Chairman or Mayor).
    
- **The Procedure**:
    
    1. If a husband fails to maintain his wife adequately, she can make an application to the Chairman.
        
    2. The Chairman then forms the Arbitration Council, which includes a representative from both the husband and the wife.
        
    3. The Council hears the parties and determines if maintenance is due. If so, it issues a **certificate** specifying the amount of maintenance to be paid. The Council can grant both past and future maintenance.
        
- **Enforcement**: This is the key strength of this remedy. If the husband fails to pay the amount specified in the certificate, the wife can have it collected as if it were **arrears of land revenue**. This is a powerful state-coerced collection method that is highly effective.

### **2. Formal Suit under The Family Courts Ordinance, 1985**

This ordinance establishes specialized **Family Courts** and provides a formal judicial route for resolving family disputes, including maintenance.

- **The Forum**: The **Family Court**, which is typically the court of an Assistant Judge.
    
- **The Procedure**:
    
    1. A wife can file a formal lawsuit (plaint) against her husband for the recovery of past and/or future maintenance.
        
    2. The court follows the standard procedures of a civil suit, including issuing summons, receiving written statements, framing issues, hearing evidence from both sides, and listening to legal arguments.
        
    3. If the wife's claim is successful, the court will issue a **decree** ordering the husband to pay a specified amount of maintenance.
        
- **Enforcement**: The decree of the Family Court is enforced through the court's own execution procedures, which can include the attachment and sale of the husband's property.
    

**Relationship between the Two Remedies**

A wife can choose either of these two avenues. The summary procedure under the MFLO is often preferred initially due to its speed and low cost. The remedies are not mutually exclusive, and a decision by the Arbitration Council does not bar a subsequent suit in the Family Court. The Family Court, being a formal judicial body, has overriding authority, and its decree will prevail.
