Of course. Let's cover the rules of maintenance during the `iddat` period.

### 8.3 During iddat ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This topic is very important because it defines the husband's final financial obligations after a marriage has ended. The wife's right to maintenance during the `iddat` (waiting period) is a crucial point of law that differs significantly depending on whether the marriage was dissolved by divorce or by the death of the husband.

#### Detailed Explanation

**`Iddat`** is the legally prescribed waiting period that a woman must observe following the dissolution of her marriage. Its primary purpose is to ascertain whether she is pregnant, thereby establishing the paternity of a potential child. During this period, the woman is prohibited from marrying another man.

A wife's entitlement to maintenance (`Nafaqah`) during `iddat` depends entirely on the mode of dissolution of her marriage.

### **1. Maintenance During the `Iddat` of Divorce (`Talaq`)**

- **The Rule**: A divorced wife is **entitled to receive full maintenance** from her ex-husband for the entire duration of her `iddat` period.
    
- **Scope**: This right applies regardless of the form of divorce, whether it is a revocable (`raji`) divorce or an irrevocable (`bain`) one (such as `khula` or a judicial divorce).
    
- **Legal Rationale**: The primary reason for this rule is that during the `iddat` of divorce, the marital tie is not considered completely and finally severed. The wife is still bound by certain obligations of the previous marriage, most importantly the prohibition on remarrying. Since she is not yet free from the effects of the marriage, her husband's duty to maintain her continues until the `iddat` period expires and she becomes free to marry again.
    
- **Duration**: The maintenance is payable for the entire `iddat` period, which is typically:
    
    - Three menstrual cycles for a menstruating woman.
        
    - Three lunar months for a woman who has passed the age of menstruation.
        
    - Until the delivery of the child, if she is pregnant.

### **2. Maintenance During the `Iddat` of Death (`Wafat`)**

- **The Rule**: According to the prevailing **Hanafi school of law**, which is followed in Bangladesh, a widow is **NOT entitled to maintenance** from her deceased husband's estate during her `iddat` of death.
    
- **Legal Rationale**: The reasoning behind this rule is that the husband's death brings about a complete and irrevocable termination of the marriage contract. At the moment of his death, all his personal obligations, including the duty of maintenance, cease to exist. The widow's financial needs are now provided for through a different legal mechanism: **inheritance (`mirath`)**. As a Qur'anic heir, she is legally entitled to inherit a prescribed share of her husband's net estate (one-fourth if there are no children, and one-eighth if there are children). This inheritance is considered her means of support during her `iddat` and beyond.
