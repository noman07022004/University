## üìå Maintenance ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: Maintenance, or **`Nafaqah`**, is a fundamental and legally enforceable financial right of the wife and a core obligation of the husband in a Muslim marriage. Disputes over the provision and amount of maintenance are one of the most frequent causes of action in the Family Courts of Bangladesh. Understanding the basis of this right, when it is applicable, and the statutory procedures for its enforcement is absolutely essential.

In Islamic law, **maintenance (`Nafaqah`)** is the husband's legal and religious duty to provide for his wife's living expenses. This obligation arises directly from the marriage contract (`'Aqd`) itself. The basis for this duty is established by the Qur'an, the Sunnah, and the consensus (`Ijma`) of jurists. The Qur'an states, "Let the man of means spend according to his means..." (65:7).

`Nafaqah` is not merely financial support; it is defined by three essential components:

1. ***Food***: Providing adequate meals.
    
2. ***Clothing***: Providing appropriate clothing for the seasons.
    
3. ***Lodging***: Providing a suitable and safe place to live.
    

The standard of maintenance is determined by the **financial capacity of the husband** and the **social status of the wife**. A key principle is that the wife's own financial status is irrelevant; the husband's duty to maintain her is absolute, even if she is wealthy.

### üü¢ Part I: The Husband's Duty and its Conditions

The husband's duty to maintain his wife is not entirely unconditional. It is contingent upon the wife fulfilling her marital obligations.

#### üí† When the Right to Maintenance Exists: 
A wife is entitled to maintenance from her husband if the following conditions are met:

1. The marriage is **valid (`sahih`)**.
    
2. She has attained an age at which the marriage can be consummated (i.e., puberty).
    
3. She places herself in her husband's home and allows him free access, being obedient to his reasonable and lawful commands.
    

#### üí† When the Right to Maintenance is Lost (Disobedience - `Nushuz`): 
A wife loses her right to claim maintenance if she is disobedient (`nashizah`). This includes situations where she:

- Leaves the marital home without a valid reason or her husband's permission.
    
- Refuses to cohabit with him without a lawful excuse.
    

However, a wife's refusal to cohabit is considered legally justified, and she **does not lose her right to maintenance**, in cases of:

- **Non-payment of prompt dower** before the marriage is consummated.
    
- The husband's cruelty, which makes it unsafe for her to live with him.

### üü¢ Part II: Statutory Rights of Maintenance in Bangladesh

In Bangladesh, the classical right to maintenance is strongly reinforced by modern statutes that provide clear procedures for enforcement.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 (MFLO):
    
- **Section 9** of the MFLO provides a crucial and efficient remedy. If a husband fails to maintain his wife adequately, she (or his children) can apply to the **Arbitration Council** (`Salishi Parishad`).
	
- The Council will issue a certificate specifying the amount of maintenance to be paid. This process is faster and less formal than a full court proceeding.
	
- If the husband fails to pay the amount specified, it can be recovered as **arrears of land revenue**, making enforcement very effective.
        
#### 2Ô∏è‚É£The Family Courts Ordinance, 1985:
    
- This ordinance establishes the **Family Courts**, which have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide suits relating to dower, maintenance, divorce, and other family matters. A wife can file a formal suit for past and future maintenance in the Family Court.

### üü¢ Part III: Maintenance During `Iddat`

`Iddat` is the waiting period a woman must observe after the dissolution of her marriage. Her right to maintenance during this period depends on how the marriage was dissolved.

#### üí† Maintenance after Divorce (`Talaq`): 
A wife is **entitled to full maintenance** from her ex-husband for the entire duration of her `iddat` period. This applies whether the divorce was revocable (`raji`) or irrevocable (`bain`). The rationale is that the marital tie is not completely severed during this time, and she is prohibited from marrying another man.
    
#### üí† Maintenance after Husband's Death: 
According to the dominant Hanafi view, a widow is **not entitled to maintenance** from her deceased husband's estate during her `iddat` of death. The rationale is that her right to maintenance ceased upon her husband's death, and her financial needs are now met through her prescribed share of **inheritance** from his estate.
