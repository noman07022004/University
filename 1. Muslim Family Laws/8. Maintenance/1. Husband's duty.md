### 8.1 Husband's duty ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This topic is the absolute core of the law of maintenance. It defines the nature, scope, and legal conditions of the husband's obligation, which serves as the foundation for any wife's legal claim. Understanding when this duty exists and when it can be suspended is fundamental to the entire subject.

#### Detailed Explanation

The husband's duty to provide **maintenance (`Nafaqah`)** is a primary and legally binding obligation that arises immediately from a valid (`sahih`) marriage contract. This duty is not merely a moral suggestion but a fundamental right of the wife, established by the Qur'an, the Sunnah, and the consensus (`Ijma`) of Islamic jurists.

**The Basis and Scope of the Duty**

The legal basis for the husband's duty is rooted in the concept of `ihtibas`, which signifies that the wife places herself under the marital authority of her husband. In exchange for this exclusivity and her fulfillment of marital duties, the husband is charged with her complete financial support.

This duty encompasses all essential living expenses, primarily defined as:

- **Food**: Providing adequate and sufficient meals.
    
- **Clothing**: Providing suitable clothing for the seasons.
    
- **Lodging**: Providing safe and appropriate accommodation.
    

The standard of this maintenance is determined by a balance between the **husband's financial capacity** and the **wife's social standing**. A husband is obligated to provide for his wife in a manner consistent with his means.

**Conditions of the Husband's Duty**

A husband is obligated to maintain his wife, provided she fulfills her own marital duties. The main conditions are:

1. She must have attained an age suitable for marital relations (i.e., puberty).
    
2. She must be obedient (`ita'at`) to his reasonable and lawful commands.
    
3. She must allow him access and place herself in his control.
    

A crucial principle is that the **wife's financial status is irrelevant**. A husband's duty to maintain his wife exists regardless of whether she is wealthy and has her own independent means of support.

**When the Duty is Suspended: Disobedience (`Nushuz`)**

A wife loses her right to claim maintenance if she is disobedient (`nashizah`). `Nushuz` refers to a wife rising against her husband's marital authority without a lawful excuse. This includes:

- Leaving the marital home against her husband's will and without a valid reason.
    
- Refusing to cohabit with him without a lawful excuse.
    

**When the Duty is NOT Suspended (Lawful Excuses)**

A wife does **not** lose her right to maintenance if her refusal to live with her husband is legally justified. The most important lawful excuses are:

- **Non-payment of Prompt Dower**: If the marriage has not been consummated, a wife has the right to refuse to live with her husband until her prompt dower is paid. He is still obligated to maintain her during this period.
    
- **Husband's Cruelty**: If the husband's behavior is cruel, making it unsafe for the wife to live in the marital home, her decision to live separately is justified, and she remains entitled to maintenance. This is a vital ground in modern family law litigation.
    
- **Husband having a serious illness**: If the husband has a contagious or dangerous disease.
