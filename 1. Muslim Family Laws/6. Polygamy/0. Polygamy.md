## üìå Polygamy ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: Polygamy (specifically polygyny) is one of the most recognized and controversial aspects of Muslim family law. Understanding its classical religious basis, the strict conditions attached to it, and, most critically, the significant statutory restrictions imposed by the state of Bangladesh is essential. The **Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961** has fundamentally altered the practice of polygamy, making this a vital topic for legal study and social discourse.

Polygyny, the practice of a man having more than one wife at the same time, is permitted in Islamic law, but this permission is neither absolute nor unconditional. It is framed within a specific Qur'anic context and is subject to rigorous conditions. In the modern legal framework of Bangladesh, this classical permission has been placed under strict state control through statutory law.

### üü¢ Part I: The Scope and Qur'anic Basis

The primary textual basis for polygyny is a single verse in the Qur'an, from **Surah An-Nisa, verse 3 (4:3)**. This verse was revealed in the socio-historical context following the Battle of Uhud, where numerous men were martyred, leaving behind a large number of widows and orphans in a vulnerable position. The verse states:

> "And if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry those that please you of [other] women, two or three or four. But if you fear that you will not be just, then [marry only] one..."

This verse establishes two critical points:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ A Numerical Limit: 
It sets a clear maximum limit of **four wives** that a man can have at any one time.
    
#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ A Strict Condition of Justice (`Adl`): 
The permission to marry more than one is explicitly conditional upon the husband's ability to treat all his wives with justice and equity.

Classical jurists have primarily interpreted this "justice" to mean equality in material and tangible aspects: providing equal food, housing, clothing, and impartially dividing his time among them.

However, a modernist or reformist interpretation argues for a stricter reading. They point to another verse in the same chapter, **Surah An-Nisa, verse 129 (4:129)**, which states:

> "You will never be able to be fair and just as between women, even if it is your ardent desire..."

Reformists argue that since the Qur'an itself declares perfect emotional justice to be impossible, the condition for polygyny is effectively impossible to meet. Therefore, they contend that the overall spirit of the Qur'anic message is to encourage **monogamy as the ideal and the norm**.

### üü¢ Part II: Classical Limitations

Even under classical jurisprudence, before any modern statutes, the permission for polygyny was not without limits:

#### üí† Numerical Limit: 
A man cannot have more than four wives. A marriage to a fifth wife while four others are subsisting is **irregular (`fasid`)**.
    
#### üí† Financial Capacity: 
A husband must have the financial ability to maintain all wives and their children equally and fairly.
    
#### üí† Unlawful Conjunction: 
He is prohibited from being simultaneously married to women who are closely related (e.g., two sisters).

### üü¢ Part III: Statutory Restrictions in Bangladesh

This is the most critical aspect of the law in Bangladesh. The practice of polygamy is strictly regulated by **Section 6 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 (MFLO)**. The Ordinance does not ban polygamy but creates a significant procedural barrier to it.

#### üí† Procedure for a Subsequent Marriage:

A husband wanting to take another wife **must** follow this procedure:

##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Application for Permission: 
He must submit an application to the local **Arbitration Council** (`Salishi Parishad`), seeking prior written permission. The application must state the reasons for the proposed marriage and whether the consent of the existing wife (or wives) has been obtained.
    
##### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Formation of the Council: 
The Council is chaired by the Union Parishad Chairman (or equivalent local government head) and includes one representative nominated by the husband and one nominated by the existing wife.
    
##### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Grounds for Granting Permission: 
The Council can only grant permission if it is satisfied that the proposed marriage is both **"necessary and just."** The law considers factors like the existing wife's sterility, physical infirmity, incurable insanity, or her refusal to live with the husband without just cause.
    

#### üí† Consequences of Violating the Law:

If a man contracts another marriage without the prior permission of the Arbitration Council, he faces severe legal penalties:

##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Criminal Sanction: 
He is liable to be prosecuted and can be sentenced to **imprisonment for up to one year, or a fine of up to 10,000 Taka, or both**.
    
##### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Immediate Payment of Dower: 
The **entire amount of the dower** (both prompt and deferred) due to the existing wife (or wives) becomes immediately due and payable on demand.
    

#### üí† Validity of the Subsequent Marriage

It is crucial to understand that a marriage contracted in violation of Section 6 of the MFLO **is not invalid or void**. The law's intent is to **regulate and deter** the practice through punitive measures, not to nullify the marriage itself.

Furthermore, a husband taking a second wife is a recognized ground for the first wife to seek divorce, either through a delegated right of divorce (`Talaq-i-Tafwid`) in her `Nikahnama` or through a judicial divorce on the grounds of cruelty or unequal treatment under the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939.
