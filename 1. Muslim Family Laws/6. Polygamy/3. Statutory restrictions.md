Of course. This subtopic is of the highest practical importance as it covers the current law in force in Bangladesh.

### 6.3 Statutory restrictions ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This is the most critical part of the topic on polygamy for any law student in Bangladesh. The classical permissions and limitations are the background, but the statutory restrictions are the **current, applicable, and enforceable law of the land**. The **Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 (MFLO)** imposes a mandatory procedure with severe criminal and civil penalties, representing a significant state intervention to regulate and control the practice.

#### Detailed Explanation

In Bangladesh, the classical Islamic law permitting polygyny has been significantly curtailed and is now strictly regulated by statute. The governing law is **Section 6 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961**. This law does not ban polygyny but establishes a formidable procedural barrier that a husband must overcome before contracting a subsequent marriage.

**The Mandatory Procedure for a Subsequent Marriage**

Under Section 6 of the MFLO, a husband who wishes to marry another woman during the subsistence of an existing marriage **must** follow these steps:

1. **Obtain Prior Permission**: He is required to obtain prior written permission from the **Arbitration Council** (`Salishi Parishad`). Contracting another marriage without this permission is illegal.
    
2. **Submit an Application**: The husband must submit a formal application to the Chairman of the relevant local government authority (e.g., the Union Parishad Chairman for rural areas). The application must specify the **reasons** for the proposed marriage and state whether the **consent** of the existing wife or wives has been obtained.
    
3. **Formation of the Arbitration Council**: Upon receiving the application, the Chairman will constitute the Arbitration Council. This council consists of the Chairman himself, a representative nominated by the husband, and a representative nominated by the existing wife (or one from each existing wife).
    
4. **Grounds for Permission**: The Council is empowered to grant permission only if it is satisfied that the proposed marriage is both **"necessary and just."** The Muslim Family Laws Rules of 1961 provide guiding factors for this decision, which include the existing wife's sterility, physical infirmity, incurable insanity, or her willful refusal to live with her husband. The consent of the existing wife is a relevant factor but is not in itself a sufficient ground for the council to grant permission.
    

**Legal Consequences of Violating the Statute**

If a man contracts a subsequent marriage without obtaining the prior permission of the Arbitration Council, he is subject to serious penalties:

- **Criminal Liability**: He can be prosecuted in a criminal court. Upon conviction, the magistrate can sentence him to:
    
    - **Simple imprisonment for up to one year**, or
        
    - **A fine of up to 10,000 Taka**, or
        
    - **Both**.
        
- **Immediate Payment of Dower**: The entire amount of the dower (`mahr`), including both the **prompt (`mu'ajjal`)** and **deferred (`mu'wajjal`)** portions, that is due to the existing wife (or wives) becomes immediately due and must be paid on demand. The wife can file a suit in the Family Court to recover this amount immediately.
    

**The Legal Status of the Subsequent Marriage**

This is a crucial point of law. A marriage contracted in violation of the procedure laid out in Section 6 **is not void or invalid**. The MFLO punishes the husband for the act of marrying without permission but does not nullify the marriage itself. If the second marriage fulfills all the religious requirements of a `Nikah`, it is a valid marriage. Consequently, the second wife has the full legal status of a wife, and any children born from that union are legitimate and entitled to inherit. The law's aim is to **deter and penalize** the practice, not to invalidate the subsequent marriage and harm the rights of the new wife and her children.
