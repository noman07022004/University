Of course. Here is the detailed explanation of the next subtopic.

### 6.2 Limitation ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This topic is highly important as it moves from the general Qur'anic scope of polygyny to the specific, concrete legal rules that restrict the practice. These limitations, such as the numerical cap and the prohibition of unlawful conjunction, are clear, enforceable principles of law. Understanding these rules is essential for determining the validity or regularity of a subsequent marriage.

#### Detailed Explanation

Beyond the primary, overarching condition of justice (`adl`), classical Islamic jurisprudence (`Fiqh`) establishes several specific and unambiguous limitations on a man's ability to contract multiple marriages. These are not subjective ethical considerations but firm legal boundaries.

**1. The Numerical Limitation**

This is the most explicit limitation on polygyny, derived directly from the text of the Qur'an (4:3).

- **The Rule**: A Muslim man can have a **maximum of four wives** at any given time.
    
- **Legal Effect of Violation**: If a man who is already married to four wives proceeds to contract a marriage with a fifth woman, that fifth marriage is not void (`batil`), but is considered **irregular (`fasid`)** under Hanafi law.
    
    - This means the contract is defective. The man is legally obligated to divorce the fifth wife.
        
    - If the irregular marriage was consummated, the wife is entitled to her dower, and any children born are considered legitimate.
        
    - The irregularity can be removed if the man divorces one of his first four wives. After the `iddat` of the divorced wife is complete, he could then contract a new, valid marriage with the woman who was previously his fifth wife.
        

**2. The Prohibition of Unlawful Conjunction (`Jam'`)**

This limitation is based on a direct Prophetic tradition (Hadith) and is designed to protect the sanctity of close family relationships.

- **The Rule**: A man is prohibited from being married, at the same time, to two women who are so related to each other by consanguinity (blood), affinity (marriage), or fosterage (milk-relationship) that if one of them had been a male, they could not have lawfully married each other.
    
- **The Classic Example**: A man cannot be married to **two sisters** simultaneously.
    
- **Other Examples**: A man cannot be married to a woman and her **aunt** (paternal or maternal) at the same time.
    
- **Legal Effect of Violation**: As with the numerical limit, a marriage that results in an unlawful conjunction is **irregular (`fasid`)**. The man must divorce the woman he married second. If it is not clear which marriage was first, he must divorce both.
    

**3. The Limitation of Financial Capacity**

While not a formal prohibition in the same way as the first two, the husband's financial capacity is an implicit and fundamental limitation.

- **The Rule**: The duty to provide maintenance (`nafaqa`) is a legally enforceable obligation upon the husband. This duty extends to all his wives and their children. Therefore, a man is not permitted to take on an additional wife if he does not have the financial means to provide for her and her children without diminishing the maintenance due to his existing family.
    
- **Practical Consequence**: A wife who is not being maintained adequately can sue her husband for maintenance. Furthermore, the husband's failure to provide maintenance for a period of two years is a specific ground upon which any of his wives can seek a judicial divorce under **The Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939**. This acts as a practical check on irresponsible polygyny.
