Of course. Here is a focused explanation of the scope of polygamy.

### 6.1 Scope ⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This topic is the essential starting point for any discussion on polygamy. It covers the foundational Qur'anic verse that grants permission for the practice, defining its boundaries and the primary condition attached to it. While the subsequent topics on limitations and statutory restrictions are more critical for modern legal practice, understanding this original scope is necessary to grasp the legal and ethical debates surrounding the issue.

#### Detailed Explanation

The "scope" of polygamy (specifically polygyny) in Islamic law refers to the extent to which the practice is permitted according to the primary scriptural sources. The entire legal basis for polygyny is derived almost exclusively from a single verse in the Qur'an, which frames it not as an unconditional right but as a permission contingent on a strict condition.

**The Primary Textual Source: Qur'an 4:3**

The foundation for the scope of polygyny is **Surah An-Nisa, verse 3 (4:3)**. The key legislative part of the verse states:

> "...marry women of your choice, two or three or four; but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one..."

From this verse, the scope of polygyny can be understood through two key principles:

1. **It is a Permission, Not an Injunction**: The verse uses permissive language. It does not command, encourage, or recommend polygyny. It presents it as a legally permissible (`mubah`) option under certain circumstances, in contrast to the pre-Islamic practice where polygyny was unlimited.
    
2. **It is Numerically Limited**: The verse sets a clear and absolute maximum limit. A man can be married to **no more than four wives** at any given time.
    

**The Overriding Condition of Justice (`Adl`)**

The most crucial aspect defining the scope of this permission is the condition attached to it: **justice**. The verse explicitly links the permission to marry more than one wife to the husband's capacity to treat them all justly. If he fears he cannot be just, the Qur'an directs him to marry "only one."

- **The Classical Interpretation of Justice**: Historically, the majority of Islamic jurists interpreted this condition of "justice" as pertaining to external, material, and measurable treatment. This includes providing:
    
    - Equal maintenance (food, clothing, and housing).
        
    - Equal division of time and companionship.
        
- **The Challenge of Emotional Justice (Qur'an 4:129)**: The scope of the justice requirement is complicated by another verse in the same chapter, **Surah An-Nisa, verse 129**, which states, "You will never be able to be fair and just as between women, even if it is your ardent desire..." This verse has led to two main interpretations:
    
    - **The Traditional View**: This interpretation holds that verse 4:129 refers to emotional justice (love, affection), which is beyond human control. Therefore, a man is not held accountable for emotional impartiality, as long as he maintains strict material and external justice, as required by verse 4:3.
        
    - **The Modernist View**: This view, held by many contemporary reformers, argues that the two verses must be read together. If the Qur'an itself states that perfect justice is impossible, then the condition for polygyny is effectively impossible to fulfill. This leads to the conclusion that the ideal state promoted by the Qur'an is **monogamy**.
        

In conclusion, the scope of polygyny in Islamic law is a conditional allowance, not a fundamental right. It is strictly limited to four wives and is entirely contingent upon the husband's ability to fulfill a demanding condition of justice, the practical feasibility of which remains a central point of legal and ethical debate.
