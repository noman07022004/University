### 18.3 The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: The MFLO is the single most important and impactful piece of legislation for reforming Muslim family law in the modern history of Bangladesh and the subcontinent. Its provisions on polygamy, divorce, inheritance, and maintenance are fundamental to the current law. It represents a significant state intervention into classical law to protect the rights of women and children.

#### Detailed Explanation

**Purpose and Objective**

The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 (MFLO) was enacted with the express purpose of reforming certain aspects of Muslim personal law to provide greater justice and protection, particularly for women and children, and to address social problems that had arisen from the application of the classical law.

**Key Reformist Provisions**

The Ordinance introduced several major changes, the most significant of which are:

**Section 4 - Succession (Inheritance for Orphaned Grandchildren)**

- **The Reform**: This section directly addressed the classical Sunni law rule that excluded the children of a predeceased son or daughter from inheriting from their grandparents.
    
- **The New Rule**: It introduces a form of **representation**. It provides that the children of a predeceased son or daughter will receive the share that their parent would have received had they been alive. This is a major social and legal reform.
    

**Section 6 - Restriction on Polygamy**

- **The Reform**: This section placed strict state control on the practice of polygyny.
    
- **The New Rule**: A husband wanting to take a second wife during an existing marriage **must** obtain prior written permission from a local administrative body called the **Arbitration Council**. Contracting a marriage in violation of this rule is a punishable offense and makes the husband's entire dower to the existing wife immediately payable.
    

**Section 7 - `Talaq` (Divorce)**

- **The Reform**: This is perhaps the most revolutionary provision. It completely reformed the procedure for the husband's unilateral divorce.
    
- **The New Rule**: It abolished the concept of an instant, irrevocable divorce (like the "triple talaq"). Under this section, **every** form of `talaq` is subject to a **mandatory 90-day notice and reconciliation period**. The husband must give written notice to the Arbitration Council and his wife. The divorce only becomes legally effective after 90 days have passed without a reconciliation.
    

**Section 9 - Maintenance**

- **The Reform**: This section provided a new, speedy, and less formal remedy for wives and children to claim maintenance.
    
- **The New Rule**: A wife or child can apply directly to the **Arbitration Council** for a maintenance certificate. If the husband fails to pay, the amount can be recovered as an arrear of land revenue, which is a very effective enforcement method.
    

**Significance and Legacy** The MFLO is the cornerstone of modern Muslim family law in Bangladesh. It did not replace the Shari'ah but created a mandatory procedural framework to regulate its application, prevent abuse, and provide more effective legal remedies. It remains a powerful instrument for the protection of family rights in the country.
