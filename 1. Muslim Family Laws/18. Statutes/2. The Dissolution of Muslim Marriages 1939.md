### 18.2 The Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act 1939 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This is a landmark statute of immense importance. It is the primary law that grants Muslim women in Bangladesh the right to go to court and seek a divorce on clearly defined grounds. It was a revolutionary piece of social reform that dramatically empowered women by providing them with an essential legal remedy that was previously very limited.

#### Detailed Explanation

**Historical Context and the Problem**

Before this Act was passed in 1939, the law governing judicial divorce for the majority of Muslims in British India was the classical Hanafi school. Under strict Hanafi law, a wife had almost no grounds to obtain a divorce from a court, except primarily for her husband's impotence. This created immense hardship for countless women who were trapped in abusive, abandoned, or otherwise intolerable marriages with no legal way out. The only recourse for many was to renounce Islam (apostasy), which was deemed to automatically dissolve the marriage—a drastic and undesirable social outcome.

**Purpose and Objective of the Act**

The Act was passed to remedy this situation. Its main purpose was to **consolidate and clarify the law** and to **expand the grounds** upon which a Muslim wife could obtain a decree for the dissolution of her marriage. The Act achieved this by largely adopting the more liberal principles of the Maliki school of law and making them available to all Muslim women, regardless of which school they followed.

**Key Provision: Section 2 (Grounds for Divorce)**

The heart of the Act is Section 2, which provides a wife with nine clear and distinct grounds to file a suit for divorce in the Family Court. These are:

1. The husband's whereabouts have been unknown for **four years**.
    
2. The husband has failed to provide **maintenance** for **two years**.
    
3. The husband has been sentenced to **imprisonment** for **seven years** or more.
    
4. The husband has failed to perform his marital obligations for **three years**.
    
5. The husband was **impotent** at the time of marriage and continues to be so.
    
6. The husband has been **insane** for two years or is suffering from leprosy or a virulent venereal disease.
    
7. The wife's exercise of her **"Option of Puberty"** (repudiating a childhood marriage).
    
8. The husband treats her with **cruelty** (which includes both physical and mental cruelty).
    
9. Any other ground which is recognized as valid for the dissolution of marriage under Muslim Law.
    

**Significance and Legacy** This Act is one of the most important pieces of legislation for protecting the rights of Muslim women in the subcontinent. It provided a powerful and effective legal remedy, shifting the balance of power within the marital relationship and giving women a clear path to exit a failed marriage through the judicial system. It remains the primary and exhaustive law governing judicial divorce (`faskh`) in Bangladesh today.
