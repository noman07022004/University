#### Detailed Explanation

**Full Title of the Act**: The Maintenance of Parents Act, 2013 (পিতা-মাতার ভরণ-পোষণ আইন, ২০১৩).

**Purpose and Objective** This Act was enacted to address the growing social problem of elderly parents being neglected by their adult children. Its primary purpose is to create a clear, legally binding, and enforceable duty on all children to provide maintenance and care for their parents.

**Key Provisions and Obligations**

- **The Duty of Maintenance (Section 3)**: The Act makes it **mandatory** for every child to provide maintenance for their parents.
    
    - This duty is placed on **both sons and daughters**.
        
    - "Maintenance" is defined to include food, clothing, shelter, and necessary medical care.
        
- **The Duty to Live with Parents**: The Act also uniquely requires children to ensure they live with their parents, emphasizing the need for companionship and direct care.
    
- **Prohibition on Forcing Parents into Old-Age Homes**: Section 5(1) of the Act explicitly prohibits any child from compelling their parents to live in an old-age home against their will.
    

**Consequences of Violation: A Punishable Offense**

The most significant feature of this Act is that it makes the failure to maintain one's parents a criminal offense.

- **The Penalty (Section 5)**: A child who fails to comply with the provisions of the Act, despite having the means to do so, is liable to be punished with a **fine of up to 100,000 Taka**.
    
- **Imprisonment for Non-Payment**: If the child fails to pay the fine, they can face **imprisonment for up to 3 months**.
    

**Significance of the Act**

- **From Moral to Legal Duty**: While caring for parents is a strong moral and religious obligation in Islam, this Act creates a clear, secular, and statutory duty that is enforceable by a court of law.
    
- **Criminal Sanction**: The introduction of a criminal penalty (a fine) demonstrates the state's serious commitment to protecting the welfare and dignity of elderly citizens.
    
- **Gender Neutrality**: By placing the obligation on all children, both male and female, the Act reflects a modern understanding of shared family responsibilities.
