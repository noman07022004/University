## üìå Statutes ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: This topic is of the highest importance as these statutes represent the codified, black-letter law of the land. While the foundation of Muslim family law is the uncodified Shari'ah, its modern application, procedures, and reforms are governed by these specific Acts and Ordinances. A thorough knowledge of these statutes is non-negotiable for any law student or practitioner in Bangladesh.

---

The legal system governing Muslim family matters in Bangladesh is a unique blend of classical Islamic jurisprudence (primarily the Hanafi school) and modern statutory law. Over the last century, several key statutes have been enacted to clarify, reform, and provide procedural frameworks for the application of Muslim personal law. These statutes are the supreme law of the land and must be applied by the courts.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937

##### üí† Purpose: 
This was a foundational Act passed during the British era. Its primary objective was to **abolish the application of local customs and usages** that were contrary to Islamic law and to formally declare that in specific personal matters, the governing rule for Muslims would be the **Shari'ah**.
    
#### üí† Key Provision (Section 2): 
The Act lists the areas where Shari'ah law is the mandatory rule of decision for courts. These include matters of marriage, all forms of divorce, dower, maintenance, guardianship, **gift**, **waqf**, and **wills**.
    
#### üí† Significance: 
This Act established the supremacy of Muslim Personal Law over conflicting local traditions, particularly protecting the rights of women to inheritance, which were often denied by custom.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ The Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939

##### üí† Purpose: 
This was a landmark piece of social reform legislation. Under classical Hanafi law, a wife had very few grounds to seek a divorce from a court. This Act was created to **codify and significantly expand the grounds** upon which a Muslim wife could obtain a judicial decree of divorce (`Faskh`).
    
##### üí† Key Provision (Section 2): 
The Act provides a clear list of grounds for a wife to file a divorce suit, including the husband's failure to provide **maintenance** for two years, his imprisonment, his failure to perform marital obligations, and his **cruelty** (both physical and mental). It also codified the wife's "Option of Puberty."
    
##### üí† Significance: 
This Act dramatically empowered Muslim women by providing them with a clear and effective legal remedy to exit an abusive or unworkable marriage.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 (MFLO)

##### üí† Purpose: 
This is the most significant and wide-ranging reformist legislation in the field. It was enacted to address certain social problems by modifying aspects of the classical law.
    
##### üí† Key Provisions:
    
- **Section 4 (Succession)**: Introduced the **principle of representation** for orphaned grandchildren, allowing them to inherit the share their predeceased parent would have received.
	
- **Section 6 (Polygamy)**: Imposed strict procedural **restrictions on polygamy**, making it mandatory for a husband to obtain prior written permission from an Arbitration Council before contracting a subsequent marriage.
	
- **Section 7 (Talaq)**: Revolutionized the law of divorce by requiring a **mandatory 90-day notice and reconciliation period** for all `talaqs`, effectively abolishing the practice of instant, irrevocable divorce.
	
- **Section 9 (Maintenance)**: Provided a **summary and effective administrative procedure** for wives and children to claim maintenance through the Arbitration Council.
        
##### üí† Significance: 
The MFLO is a cornerstone of modern family law in Bangladesh, introducing major reforms aimed at protecting the rights of women and children.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Pita-Matar Bharan-Poshan Ain, 2013 (Maintenance of Parents Act)

##### üí† Purpose: 
This is a modern social welfare law designed to address the needs of elderly parents. Its objective is to create a **legally binding obligation on children to maintain their parents**.
    
##### üí† Key Provisions: 
The Act requires every child (both sons and daughters) to provide for the maintenance of their parents. It also requires them to live with their parents and provide them with proper care. **Failure to maintain one's parents**, despite having the ability to do so, is made a **punishable offense**.
    
##### üí† Significance: 
While Islamic law already imposes a moral and religious duty on children to care for their parents, this Act transforms it into a clear, secular, and enforceable statutory obligation with criminal sanctions.
