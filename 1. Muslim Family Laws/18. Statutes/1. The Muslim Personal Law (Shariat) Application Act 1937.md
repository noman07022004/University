#### Detailed Explanation

**Historical Context and Purpose**

During the British colonial period, courts in many parts of India would often apply local or family **customs and usages** to decide on matters of personal law for Muslims. This created a major problem, as many of these customs were contrary to the principles of Islamic law. For example, in some communities, custom completely denied women their Qur'anic right to inherit property.

In response to demands from the Muslim community to be governed by their own religious law, the British Indian legislature passed this Act. Its primary objective was to **abolish the application of custom** and to mandate that in specific personal matters, the rule of decision for Muslims shall be the **Muslim Personal Law (Shari'ah)**.

**Key Provision (Section 2)**

The heart of the Act is Section 2. It states that notwithstanding any custom to the contrary, in all questions regarding the following subjects, the rule of decision in cases where the parties are Muslim shall be the Muslim Personal Law:

- Intestate succession (inheritance)
    
- Special property of females
    
- Marriage
    
- Dissolution of marriage (in all its forms)
    
- Maintenance
    
- Dower
    
- Guardianship
    
- Gifts
    
- Waqf
    

**Significance and Legacy**

- **Supremacy of Shari'ah**: The Act unequivocally established the supremacy of Shari'ah over conflicting local customs in the specified areas.
    
- **Protection of Women's Rights**: It was a crucial piece of legislation for securing the rights of Muslim women, especially their right to inherit property as prescribed by the Qur'an.
    
- **Defining Personal Law**: It legally defined the scope of Muslim Personal Law within the legal system of the subcontinent. This Act continues to be the foundational law in Bangladesh that directs the courts to apply Muslim law in these family and property matters.
