## üìå Shia Law of Inheritance ‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Not as Critical**: While important for a comprehensive understanding of Islamic jurisprudence, the Shia law of inheritance is of less practical importance for most law students in Bangladesh. The overwhelming majority of the Muslim population in Bangladesh are Sunnis who follow the Hanafi school, and it is the Sunni law that is primarily applied in the courts. This topic is therefore supplementary to the core syllabus on Sunni law.

The Shia law of inheritance, while originating from the same primary source (the Qur'an), differs from the Sunni system in its fundamental classification of heirs and principles of distribution. The most significant departure is that Shia law **does not recognize the `Asabat` (Residuaries)** as a separate class of heirs, thereby removing the preference for agnatic (male-line) relatives.

*** üí† General Principles and Classification of Heirs***

Shia law divides heirs into two main groups:

1. ***Heirs by Marriage (`Sabab`)***: The husband or the wife.
    
2. ***Heirs by Blood (`Nasab`)***: All blood relatives.
    

The surviving spouse (husband or wife) always inherits alongside the nearest blood relatives. The blood relatives are further divided into **three hierarchical classes**. A member of a higher class completely excludes all members of a lower class.

### üü¢ Part I: The Three Classes of Heirs by Blood

The core of the Shia system is this strict classification.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Class I Heirs

1. **Parents** (Father and Mother).
    
2. **Children and their lineal descendants** (sons, daughters, grandchildren, etc.).
    

- **Rule**: If any heir from Class I is alive, the entire estate (after paying the spouse's share) will be distributed among them. All heirs from Class II and Class III will be **completely excluded**.
    

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Class II Heirs

1. **Grandparents** (how high soever, both paternal and maternal).
    
2. **Brothers and Sisters** (full, consanguine, or uterine) and their lineal descendants.
    

- **Rule**: This class only inherits if there is **no heir from Class I**.
    

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Class III Heirs

1. **Paternal and Maternal Uncles and Aunts** of the deceased and their descendants.
    

- **Rule**: This class only inherits if there is **no heir from either Class I or Class II**.

### üü¢ Part II: Principles of Distribution and Miscellaneous Rules

#### üí† No Agnatic Preference: 
Shia law does not prioritize relatives through the male line. A daughter's child has the same standing as a son's child within their respective positions.
    
#### üí† Per Stirpes Distribution: 
Distribution among descendants of a deceased heir is `per stirpes`. This means the children of a predeceased son will collectively take the share that their father would have taken and divide it among themselves. This is a form of **representation**.
    
#### üí† The Doctrine of Return (`Radd`): 
If there is a residue after the Sharers have been paid, it is "returned" to them in proportion to their shares. The **husband is entitled** to participate in this return, but the **wife is generally not** if there are other blood relatives.
    
#### üí† No Doctrine of Increase (`Awl`): 
The Shia school **does not recognize the Doctrine of `Awl`**. If the sum of the fractional shares is greater than one, the deficit is not proportionately deducted from all heirs. Instead, the reduction is borne exclusively by those heirs whose shares are variable, primarily the **daughter(s) or sister(s)**.
