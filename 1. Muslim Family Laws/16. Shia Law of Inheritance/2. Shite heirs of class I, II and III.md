Of course. Here is the explanation for the next subtopic on the Shia classes of heirs.

### 16.2 Shia heirs of class I, II and III ⭐⭐

**Why Not as Critical**: This topic details the specific rules of distribution for the Shia system of inheritance. While important for a comprehensive academic understanding, these rules are rarely applied in Bangladesh, where the Sunni (Hanafi) system is dominant.

#### Detailed Explanation

The Shia law of inheritance distributes the estate among the deceased's blood relatives based on a strict hierarchy of three classes. The existence of any heir in a higher class completely excludes all heirs in the lower classes.

**Class I Heirs**

- **Who they are**:
    
    1. Parents (Father and Mother).
        
    2. Children and their lineal descendants (grandchildren, etc.).
        
- **Rules of Distribution**:
    
    - If the deceased leaves both parents and children, the **parents each take a 1/6 share** as Qur'anic Sharers. The **remainder of the estate (4/6 or 2/3) is distributed among the children**.
        
    - Among the children, a son takes double the share of a daughter (a 2:1 ratio).
        
    - If a child has died before the deceased, their own children (the grandchildren) will represent them and inherit the share their parent would have received.
        

**Class II Heirs**

- **Who they are**:
    
    1. Grandparents and higher ancestors.
        
    2. Brothers and Sisters and their descendants.
        
- **Rules of Distribution**:
    
    - This class **only inherits if there are no Class I heirs**.
        
    - The estate is divided between the grandparents and the siblings. The general rule is that grandparents from the paternal side take a 2/3 share of their allocation, while those from the maternal side take 1/3.
        
    - Among the siblings, full and paternal siblings divide their share according to the 2:1 male-to-female ratio. Uterine siblings (sharing the same mother only) divide their share equally.
        
    - Descendants of a deceased brother or sister represent their parent and inherit their share.
        

**Class III Heirs**

- **Who they are**:
    
    1. Paternal and Maternal Uncles and Aunts of the deceased, and their descendants.
        
- **Rules of Distribution**:
    
    - This class **only inherits if there are no heirs from Class I or Class II**.
        
    - The rules for distribution are complex, but the general principle is that the paternal side (paternal uncles and aunts) receives 2/3 of the estate, and the maternal side (maternal uncles and aunts) receives 1/3.
        

In all cases, the surviving spouse (husband or wife) takes their fixed Qur'anic share alongside the relevant class of blood relatives.
