Of course. Let's cover the final subtopic on Shia inheritance.

### 16.3 Anomalies and miscellaneous rules ⭐⭐

**Why Not as Critical**: These rules are technical details of the Shia system of inheritance. While they highlight the important logical differences from Sunni law, they apply to a legal system that is not primary in Bangladesh, making them supplementary knowledge.

#### Detailed Explanation

Shia law has its own distinct methods for dealing with anomalous cases where the prescribed shares of the heirs do not neatly add up to the whole estate. These methods are fundamentally different from the Sunni solutions.

**1. The Doctrine of Return (`Radd`)**

- **The Problem**: This is applied when the sum of the shares of the Qur'anic Heirs is **less than one**, leaving a surplus, and there are no other heirs in the same class to take it.
    
- **The Shia Solution**: The surplus is "returned" to the Sharers in proportion to their shares.
    
- **Key Difference from Sunni Law**:
    
    - The **husband is entitled** to participate in the `Radd` if there are no other blood relatives.
        
    - The **wife is generally excluded** from the `Radd` if there are any other blood relatives (from any of the three classes).
        

**Example**: A Shia woman dies leaving only her **Husband**.

- Husband's Qur'anic share = 1/2.
    
- The remaining 1/2 of the estate is "returned" to him by `Radd`.
    
- **Result**: The Husband inherits the entire estate.

**2. The Rejection of the Doctrine of Increase (`Awl`)**

- **The Problem**: This is the situation where the sum of the shares is **greater than one**, meaning the estate is not large enough to give everyone their full Qur'anic share.
    
- **The Shia Solution**: Shia law **completely rejects the Doctrine of `Awl`**. It does not proportionately reduce the shares of all the heirs.
    
- **The Shia Method**: Instead, the deficit or reduction is borne **exclusively** by the heir(s) whose share is considered variable. This means the reduction falls only upon the:
    
    - **Daughter(s)**, or
        
    - **Full or Paternal Sister(s)**. The shares of other heirs, like the husband, wife, father, and mother, are considered fixed and are **never reduced**.
        

**Example**: A Shia woman dies leaving a **Husband** and **two Full Sisters**.

- **Standard Shares**: Husband = 1/2; Two Sisters = 2/3.
    
- **The Problem**: 1/2 + 2/3 = 7/6. The shares exceed the estate.
    
- **The Sunni Solution** would be to apply `Awl`, giving the Husband 3/7 and the Sisters 4/7.
    
- **The Shia Solution (No `Awl`)**:
    
    - The Husband's share is fixed. He receives his full **1/2**.
        
    - The two Sisters, whose shares are considered variable, receive whatever is left. They get the remaining **1/2** to share between them. The entire deficit is deducted from their portion.
