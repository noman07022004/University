### 16.1 General principles and classification of heirs ⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: These principles are the absolute foundation of the Shia system and are essential for understanding its unique logic. The primary distinction from Sunni law—the rejection of the `Asabat` (Residuaries) and the classification into three hierarchical groups—is a core concept.

#### Detailed Explanation

The Shia law of inheritance is built on a framework that is fundamentally different from the Sunni system. Its principles and classification of heirs lead to significantly different outcomes in the distribution of property.

**Key General Principles**

1. **No `Asabat` (Residuaries)**: This is the most important principle and the primary point of departure from Sunni law. Shia law **does not recognize the `Asabat`** (agnatic residuaries) as a distinct class of heirs. There is no special priority given to relatives connected to the deceased through a male-only line. Relatives through females (cognates) and relatives through males (agnates) are treated on a more equal footing.
    
2. **The Spouse is Never Excluded**: The surviving husband or wife is a special heir by marriage (`sabab`). They **always inherit** their prescribed share alongside the closest surviving blood relatives. They are never excluded, nor do they exclude any blood relatives.
    
3. **Principle of Representation**: Shia law fully recognizes a system of representation. The descendants of a predeceased heir (e.g., a predeceased son's children) step into the shoes of that heir and inherit the share their parent would have received had they been alive.
    

**The Classification of Heirs**

Shia law divides all heirs into two main groups: Heirs by Marriage and Heirs by Blood. The heirs by blood are then divided into three hierarchical classes.

**Group 1: Heirs by Marriage (`Sabab`)**

- The Husband or the Wife.
    

**Group 2: Heirs by Blood (`Nasab`)** These heirs are divided into three classes that have a strict order of priority.

- **The Rule of Exclusion**: The existence of **any heir** from a higher class **completely excludes all heirs** from the lower classes.
    
- **Class I**:
    
    1. Parents (Father and Mother).
        
    2. Children and their lineal descendants (grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc.).
        
    
    - _Example: If a person dies leaving a mother and a daughter's son, both are in Class I. They will inherit the entire estate (after the spouse's share), and all relatives in Class II and III get nothing._
        
- **Class II**:
    
    1. Grandparents and higher ancestors.
        
    2. Brothers and Sisters and their descendants.
        
    
    - _Example: This class only inherits if there are NO parents and NO children or other lineal descendants._
        
- **Class III**:
    
    1. Paternal and Maternal Uncles and Aunts and their descendants.
        
    
    - _Example: This class only inherits if there are NO heirs from Class I and NO heirs from Class II._
