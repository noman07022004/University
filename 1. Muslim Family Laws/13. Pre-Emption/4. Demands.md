Of course. Let's cover the crucial procedure of making the demands for pre-emption.

### 13.4 Demands ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: The performance of the two formal "demands," or **`talabs`**, is the **single most important procedural requirement** in the classical law of pre-emption. This is not a mere formality; it is the essential act that establishes and preserves the claimant's right. Failure to perform these demands correctly and at the proper time is **fatal to the claim** and results in the complete and permanent loss of the right.

#### Detailed Explanation

Because `Shuf'a` is considered a "feeble right" that interferes with a valid contract, the law requires a claimant to demonstrate their serious and immediate intention to exercise it through a strict, two-step procedure.

**1. The First Demand: `Talab-i-Muwathibat` (The Immediate Demand)**

This is often called the "demand of jumping" because of the immediacy with which it must be performed.

- **The Rule**: As soon as a person entitled to pre-empt learns of the sale, they must **immediately** declare their intention to claim their right.
    
- **Immediacy is Key**: Any unreasonable or unexplained delay between hearing the news and making this declaration will extinguish the right forever. The pre-emptor must assert their claim on the spot.
    
- **Form**: No specific legal formula is required. Any words that clearly express the intention to pre-empt are sufficient (e.g., "I claim my right of Shuf'a," or "I will pre-empt"). Witnesses are not legally required for this first demand, but it is always advisable to make the declaration in front of people for the purpose of proof.
    

**2. The Second Demand: `Talab-i-Ishhad` (The Demand with Witnesses)**

After the first demand has been made, the pre-emptor must follow it up with a second, more formal demand.

- **The Rule**: The pre-emptor must, as soon as practicable, re-affirm their claim in the presence of witnesses.
    
- **The Procedure**: This second demand has three essential components:
    
    1. It must be made in the presence of **at least two witnesses**.
        
    2. It must be made either **on the property in question** OR in the presence of the **seller** (if they are still in possession) OR in the presence of the **buyer**.
        
    3. The pre-emptor **must explicitly refer** to the fact that they had already made the first, immediate demand (`Talab-i-Muwathibat`). For example, they might say, "I have already claimed my right of pre-emption, and I do so again now in your presence."
        

**3. The Third Step: `Talab-i-Tamlik` (The Demand of Possession)**

This is not a demand in the same way as the first two, but rather the final legal action.

- **The Rule**: If the buyer refuses to hand over the property after the first two demands have been made, the pre-emptor must enforce their right by filing a **lawsuit** in the appropriate court. This suit must be filed within the prescribed period of limitation (typically one year).
    

The successful performance of the first two `talabs` is a mandatory prerequisite for filing a valid pre-emption suit under classical Muslim law.
