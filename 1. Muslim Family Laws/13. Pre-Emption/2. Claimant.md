Of course. Here is an explanation of the claimants in pre-emption.

### 13.2 Claimant ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This topic is fundamental as it identifies who has the legal standing to exercise the right of pre-emption. The classification of claimants (`shafis`) and their strict order of priority are core legal rules that determine whether a person is entitled to make a claim of `Shuf'a`.

#### Detailed Explanation

A person who has the right to claim pre-emption is called a **pre-emptor** or, in Arabic, a **`shafi`**. Muslim law recognizes three distinct classes of claimants. These classes have a strict hierarchy, meaning a person in a lower category can only make a claim if no one from a higher category exists or if they have waived their right.

**The Three Classes of Claimants**

1. **The Co-sharer (`Shafi-i-Sharik`)**
    
    - **Who they are**: A person who is a **co-owner** and has a share in the actual body of the property that has been sold. This includes co-heirs who jointly own a property.
        
    - **Priority**: This class has the **first and highest priority**. As long as a co-sharer wishes to pre-empt, no one from the other two classes can make a claim.
        
    - **Example**: Fatima and Ayesha are co-owners of a plot of land. If Ayesha sells her half-share to a stranger, Fatima, as the `shafi-i-sharik`, has the primary right to pre-empt the sale.
        
2. **The Participator in Immunities (`Shafi-i-Khalit`)**
    
    - **Who they are**: A person who is not a co-owner of the property itself but shares in its **appendages or immunities**. This refers to a person who has a right of easement over the property.
        
    - **Priority**: This class has the **second priority**.
        
    - **Examples**: Sharing a private path to access one's house or sharing a common channel for water drainage. The right must be private, not a general public right.
        
3. **The Owner of Adjoining Property (`Shafi-i-Jar`)**
    
    - **Who they are**: A person who owns the immovable property that is **adjoining or contiguous** to the property that has been sold. This is the right of a **neighbor**.
        
    - **Priority**: This class has the **third and weakest priority**. A neighbor can only claim pre-emption if there are no claimants from the first two classes.
        

It is important to remember that under the statutory law of pre-emption in Bangladesh (**The State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950**), which applies to agricultural land, the right is granted **only to the first class**, the co-sharer.
