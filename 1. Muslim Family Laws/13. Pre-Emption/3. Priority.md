Of course. Let's cover the rules of priority in pre-emption.

### 13.3 Priority ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: The rules of priority are a fundamental part of the law of `Shuf'a`. They establish a clear and strict hierarchy among the different classes of claimants. This hierarchy is essential for determining who has the superior right to pre-empt when multiple potential claimants exist.

#### Detailed Explanation

When there are multiple persons who could potentially claim the right of pre-emption over a single sale, Muslim law does not leave their rights in ambiguity. It establishes a clear and strict order of priority to determine whose claim will prevail. This is governed by two main principles: the rule of exclusion and the rule of competition.

**1. The Rule of Exclusion (Between Different Classes)**

The three classes of pre-emptors (`shafis`) **exclude one another** in a fixed order. A claimant from a lower category is completely excluded by the presence of a claimant from a higher category.

The hierarchy is as follows:

1. **First Priority**: The **Co-sharer (`Shafi-i-Sharik`)**.
    
    - A co-sharer's right is absolute and superior to all others. As long as a co-sharer exists and asserts their right, no one from the other two classes can make a claim.
        
2. **Second Priority**: The **Participator in Immunities (`Shafi-i-Khalit`)**.
    
    - A participator in immunities can only exercise their right if there is no co-sharer, or if all co-sharers have waived or forfeited their right.
        
3. **Third Priority**: The **Owner of Adjoining Property (`Shafi-i-Jar`)**.
    
    - A neighbor has the last and weakest right. They can only make a claim if there are no claimants from either of the first two classes.
        

**Example**: Ali sells a piece of land. B is a co-sharer in that land, and C is the owner of the adjoining plot. B has the first right to pre-empt. C has no right at all as long as B is willing to exercise his claim. If B formally waives his right, then C can proceed with his claim.

**2. The Rule of Competition (Within the Same Class)**

If there are multiple pre-emptors who belong to the **same class**, the law treats their rights as equal.

- **The Rule**: All pre-emptors within the same class are entitled to claim the right of pre-emption **jointly in equal shares**. The size of their existing property or share is irrelevant to their claim.
    
- **Example**: A, B, and C are co-owners of a property, with A owning a 50% share, B owning 30%, and C owning 20%. If A sells his 50% share to a stranger, both B and C, being `Shafi-i-Shariks`, have an equal right to pre-empt. They will divide the purchased 50% share equally between them (each getting 25%), regardless of the fact that their original shares were unequal.
