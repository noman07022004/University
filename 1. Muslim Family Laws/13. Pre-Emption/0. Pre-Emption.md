## üü¢ Pre-Emption ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: Pre-emption, or **`Shuf'a`**, is a unique and important right within Muslim property law. It allows a person with a qualifying interest in a property to step into the shoes of a buyer and take the property for themselves at the same price. This topic is crucial as it intersects with general property law and is also heavily regulated by statute in Bangladesh, particularly concerning agricultural land.

**`Shuf'a`** is the right of a person to acquire ownership of an immovable property by substituting themselves in place of a stranger who has purchased it. It is not a right to repurchase but a right of **substitution**. The right comes into existence only after a valid sale of the property to a third party is complete.

The primary objective of this law is to prevent the inconvenience and potential disruption that may be caused by the introduction of a stranger as a new co-owner or a new next-door neighbor, thus preserving the privacy and comfort of the original owners. Due to its nature of interfering with a valid contract, it is considered a **feeble or weak right**, and the law requires that it be exercised with extreme diligence.

### üü¢ Part I: The Claimants and Their Priority

There are three classes of people who are entitled to claim the right of pre-emption. They have a strict order of priority, meaning a person in a lower category can only claim the right if no one from a higher category wishes to exercise it.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ The Co-sharer (`Shafi-i-Sharik`):
    
- **Definition**: A person who is a co-owner or partner in the property that has been sold.
	
- **Priority**: This class has the **highest and strongest claim**.
        
#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ The Participator in Immunities (`Shafi-i-Khalit`):
    
- **Definition**: A person who is not a co-owner of the property itself but shares in its appendages or immunities, such as a private right of way, a right to a shared watercourse for irrigation, or other common easements.
	
- **Priority**: This class has the second right to claim pre-emption.
        
#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ The Owner of Adjoining Property (`Shafi-i-Jar`):
    
- **Definition**: A person who owns the immovable property that is contiguous or adjacent to the property that has been sold. This is the right of a "neighbor."
	
- **Priority**: This class has the **last and weakest right**.

### üü¢ Part II: The Demands (`Talabs`)

The right of pre-emption is lost if a very strict, two-step formal procedure of making "demands" is not followed precisely and immediately.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ The First Demand (`Talab-i-Muwathibat` - The Immediate Demand):
    
- **Rule**: As soon as the pre-emptor (the `shafi`) learns of the sale, they must **immediately** declare their intention to exercise their right. This is sometimes called the "jumping demand" because it must be made on the spot.
	
- **Effect of Delay**: Any unreasonable delay in making this first demand will cause the right of pre-emption to be extinguished forever.
        
#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ The Second Demand (`Talab-i-Ishhad` - The Demand with Witnesses):
    
- **Rule**: After making the first demand, the pre-emptor must, as soon as practicable, make a second, more formal demand.
	
- **Procedure**: The pre-emptor must go to the property in question, or to the seller, or to the buyer, and, in the presence of **at least two witnesses**, re-affirm their claim and expressly refer to the fact that they had already made the first immediate demand.
        

Failure to comply with the exact formalities of these two demands is fatal to the claim of pre-emption under classical Muslim law. After the demands are made, the pre-emptor must file a lawsuit to enforce their right.

### üü¢ Part III: Statutory Provisions in Bangladesh

The classical law of `Shuf'a` has been significantly impacted by statutory law in Bangladesh.

#### üí† For Non-agricultural and Urban Land: 
The classical Muslim law of pre-emption, with its three classes of pre-emptors and the requirement of the two `talabs`, still applies to Muslims.
    
#### üí† For Agricultural Land: 
The law has been largely superseded by **Section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 (SATA)**.
    
- ***Who can claim?*** The statutory right of pre-emption is available **only to a co-sharer tenant** in the holding. The other two classes (`Shafi-i-Khalit` and `Shafi-i-Jar`) have **no right** of pre-emption over agricultural land.
	
- ***Procedure***: The strict requirement of the two formal `talabs` is **not necessary**. The co-sharer simply has to file an application in the court within a prescribed time limit (two months from the knowledge of the sale).
	
- ***Applicability***: This statutory right applies to all citizens of Bangladesh, irrespective of their religion.
