Of course. Let's cover the final subtopic on Family Court litigation.

### 17.4 Appeal ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: The right to appeal is a fundamental part of the judicial process, allowing a party to challenge a decision they believe is incorrect. Knowing the specific and limited rules for appealing a Family Court decision—where to file, the time limit, and the finality of the appellate decision—is essential procedural knowledge.

---

#### Detailed Explanation

If a party is aggrieved by the judgment and decree of a Family Court, the law provides them with a right to appeal. The rules for this process are laid out in **The Family Courts Ordinance, 1985**.

**The Appellate Forum**

- **The Rule**: An appeal from the decision of a Family Court (presided over by an Assistant Judge) lies to the court of the **District Judge**.
    

**Time Limit for Filing an Appeal**

- **The Rule**: A party must file their appeal within **30 days** from the date the judgment and decree were passed by the Family Court. This is a strict deadline.
    

**Finality of the Appellate Decision**

This is a key feature of the Family Court system.

- **The Rule**: **Section 17** of the Ordinance states that the decision of the District Judge on an appeal shall be **final**.
    
- **What this means**: There is **no provision for a "second appeal"** to the High Court Division. This is a departure from the regular civil court procedure and is designed to bring a swift conclusion to family disputes.
    
- **Further Recourse**: While there is no further _appeal_, a decision of the District Judge can still be challenged in the High Court Division, not as an appeal, but through its constitutional **writ jurisdiction** or its **revisional jurisdiction** if there is a serious error of law or lack of jurisdiction.
    

**When No Appeal is Allowed**

The right to appeal is not absolute. No appeal can be filed against a decree of the Family Court if that decree was passed on the basis of a **compromise or settlement** reached between the parties during the mandatory conciliation proceedings.
