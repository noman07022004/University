Of course. Let's cover the unique conciliation procedure of the Family Court.

### 17.3 Conciliation procedure ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: The mandatory, two-stage conciliation is a unique and defining feature of the Family Court's process. It is a significant departure from the typically adversarial nature of other civil courts and highlights the court's special duty to not just adjudicate, but to actively try and resolve family disputes amicably. Understanding this procedure is key to understanding how family courts operate.

#### Detailed Explanation

A core objective of the Family Courts Ordinance, 1985, is to encourage the amicable settlement of family disputes. To achieve this, the law makes it a **mandatory duty** for the Family Court to attempt conciliation between the parties at two distinct stages of the lawsuit.

**The Governing Law**

The conciliation process is primarily governed by **Section 10** (Pre-trial Conciliation) and **Section 13** (Post-trial Conciliation) of The Family Courts Ordinance, 1985.

**The Two Mandatory Stages of Conciliation**

**1. Pre-Trial Conciliation (Section 10)** This is the first formal attempt at reaching a compromise.

- **When it Occurs**: This stage takes place **after** the defendant has submitted their written statement (their formal reply to the lawsuit), but **before** the court proceeds to the formal trial (i.e., before framing issues and recording evidence).
    
- **The Procedure**: The judge holds an informal hearing, often in their private chamber (`in-camera`), to protect the privacy of the parties. The judge's role is to act as a mediator, exploring the possibility of a settlement or reconciliation.
    
- **Outcome**:
    
    - **If Successful**: If the parties reach an agreement, the court will record the terms of their compromise and pass a decree accordingly. The case is then resolved.
        
    - **If it Fails**: If no compromise is reached, the court will fix a date to proceed with the formal trial.
        

**2. Post-Trial Conciliation (Section 13)** This is the second and final mandatory attempt at settlement.

- **When it Occurs**: This stage takes place **after** the trial has concluded (all evidence has been recorded and final arguments have been heard), but **before** the judge pronounces the final judgment.
    
- **The Procedure**: The court must, once again, make an effort to bring the parties to an amicable settlement.
    
- **Outcome**:
    
    - **If Successful**: If the parties agree to a compromise at this late stage, the court will pass a decree on the basis of that compromise.
        
    - **If it Fails**: If this final attempt also fails, the judge will then pronounce the final judgment based on the merits of the case and the evidence presented during the trial.
        

This compulsory, dual-stage conciliation process underscores the unique role of the Family Court in prioritizing the preservation of the family unit and the peaceful resolution of disputes.
