## 📌 Family Court Litigation ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

>**Why Important**: This is a critical topic of the highest practical importance. While the preceding topics have detailed the substantive rights and obligations under Muslim family law, this topic explains the **actual legal forum and procedure** for enforcing those rights in Bangladesh. A law student must have a thorough understanding of the jurisdiction, procedures, and appeal process of the Family Court, as this is the arena where family law is put into practice.

---
In Bangladesh, disputes arising from Muslim personal law are not adjudicated in regular civil courts. Instead, they are resolved in specialized courts that follow a unique and simplified procedure. The entire legal framework for this is provided by **The Family Courts Ordinance, 1985**.

### 🟢 Part I: Establishment and Jurisdiction

#### 💠 Establishment: 
The Ordinance establishes a **Family Court** in every Upazila. These are not separate buildings; the existing court of the **Assistant Judge** is designated to act as the Family Court for its local area.
    
#### 💠 Exclusive Jurisdiction: 
**Section 5** of the Ordinance grants the Family Court **exclusive jurisdiction** to try and decide all suits relating to the following five matters:
    
1. Dissolution of marriage
	
2. Restitution of conjugal rights (a suit to compel a spouse to return to the marital home)
	
3. Dower (`mahr`)
	
4. Maintenance (`nafaqa`)
	
5. Guardianship (`wilayat`) and Custody (`hizanat`) of children.
        

For these five specific areas, no other court has the authority to hear the case.

### 🟢 Part II: The Conciliation Procedure

A unique and mandatory feature of the Family Court is its emphasis on reconciliation. The Ordinance requires the court to attempt to reach an amicable settlement between the parties at two different stages:

1. ***Pre-trial Conciliation***: After the defendant has filed their written statement (their formal reply to the lawsuit) but **before** the formal trial begins, the court must hold a hearing to try and bring about a compromise.
    
2. ***Post-trial Conciliation***: After all the evidence has been presented and the trial is complete, but **before** the judge pronounces the final judgment, the court must make one final effort to reconcile the parties.
    

This dual-stage conciliation process underscores the law's objective to preserve the family unit wherever possible. The proceedings are often held **in-camera** (in private) to protect the family's privacy.

### 🟢 Part III: Appeal

- ***The Right to Appeal***: A party who is dissatisfied with the judgment and decree of the Family Court has the right to appeal.
    
- ***The Appellate Forum***: An appeal from the decision of the Family Court (presided over by an Assistant Judge) lies to the court of the **District Judge**.
    
- ***Time Limit***: The appeal must be filed within **30 days** of the date the judgment was passed.
    
- ***Finality***: The decision of the District Judge on the appeal is considered **final**. No further appeal is permitted, although the decision may be challenged in the High Court Division through its constitutional writ or revisional jurisdictions.
