#### Detailed Explanation

The jurisdiction of the Family Court in Bangladesh is special and limited. It does not have the power to hear all types of civil cases; its authority is strictly confined to the matters specified in the ordinance that created it.

**The Governing Law**

The jurisdiction of the Family Court is defined in **Section 5 of The Family Courts Ordinance, 1985**.

**Exclusive Jurisdiction**

The Ordinance grants the Family Court **exclusive jurisdiction** to hear and decide suits relating to the following five specific matters:

1. **Dissolution of Marriage**: A wife's suit for a judicial divorce (`faskh`).
    
2. **Restitution of Conjugal Rights**: A suit by one spouse to compel the other to resume marital life.
    
3. **Dower (`Mahr`)**: All suits for the recovery of unpaid dower.
    
4. **Maintenance (`Nafaqah`)**: All suits for the maintenance of a wife or children.
    
5. **Guardianship and Custody (`Wilayat` and `Hizanat`)**: All disputes over the appointment of a guardian and the physical custody of a child.
    

The term "exclusive" is crucial. It means that for these five issues, the Family Court is the **only** court with the legal authority to handle the case. A regular civil court is barred from entertaining such suits.
