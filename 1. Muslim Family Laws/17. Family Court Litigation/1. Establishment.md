#### Detailed Explanation

To ensure the speedy and effective resolution of sensitive family disputes, the legal system of Bangladesh provides for specialized courts. The establishment of these courts is not based on tradition but on a specific modern statute.

**The Governing Law**

The entire framework for the creation of these courts is provided by **The Family Courts Ordinance, 1985**.

**The Method of Establishment**

The Ordinance did not create a completely new and separate judicial infrastructure. Instead, it utilized the existing civil court system.

- **Section 3** of the Ordinance directs the government to establish one or more Family Courts in every Upazila and for metropolitan areas.
    
- **Section 4** clarifies how this is done: The existing court of the **Assistant Judge** is designated to be the **Family Court** for its respective local jurisdiction.
    

Therefore, the Family Court is not a separate building or a different type of judge. It is an **Assistant Judge** who is specially empowered by this Ordinance to hear family law cases and follow the unique procedures prescribed by it. This system ensures that a specialized forum for family justice is accessible throughout the country.
