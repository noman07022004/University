Of course. Let's cover the topic of competence to inherit.

### 15.2 Competence ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This topic is very important as it defines the gateway to inheritance. It outlines the fundamental qualifications a person must have to be considered a legal heir and the specific impediments that can completely disqualify them from receiving a share. These are strict rules with absolute consequences.

#### Detailed Explanation

For a person to be able to inherit from a deceased Muslim, they must first be **competent**. This means they must possess a legally recognized relationship with the deceased and must not be subject to any specific disqualifications.

**Part I: Grounds for Competence**

There are two primary relationships that create the right to inherit:

1. **Legitimate Blood Relationship (`Nasab`)**: Any person related to the deceased through a lawful blood tie is a potential heir. This includes all classes of heirs—Sharers, Residuaries, and Distant Kindred. This ground excludes an **illegitimate child**, who under Sunni law has no legal relationship with their putative father and therefore cannot inherit from him.
    
2. **Valid Marriage (`Sabab`)**: A valid (`sahih`) marriage that is existing at the time of one of the spouse's death creates a mutual right of inheritance between the husband and wife. The surviving spouse is a primary Qur'anic heir. This right is lost if the divorce has become irrevocable (`bain`).
    

**Part II: Grounds for Disqualification**

Even if a person has a valid relationship through blood or marriage, they can be barred from inheriting if they are subject to one of the following impediments:

1. **Homicide**: Under Hanafi law, a person who has **caused the death** of the deceased is disqualified from inheriting from that person.
    
    - **Scope**: This is a very strict rule and applies whether the killing was **intentional** (murder) or **unintentional** (accidental).
        
    - **Rationale**: This rule is based on public policy to prevent a person from profiting from their own wrongful act and accelerating their inheritance.
        
2. **Difference of Religion**: A **non-Muslim cannot inherit from a Muslim** under the traditional application of Muslim law.
    
    - **Example**: If a Muslim father has a son who has converted to another religion, that son is barred from inheriting his father's property.
        
3. **Slavery**: In classical law, a slave could not own property and therefore could not inherit. This ground is now obsolete.
    

It is also important to distinguish disqualification from **Exclusion (`Hajb`)**. Disqualification is a personal impediment (like being a killer). Exclusion is a rule of priority where a potential heir is "excluded" from their share by the presence of a nearer relative (e.g., a son excludes a grandson).
