Of course. Let's cover the final subtopic on miscellaneous rules in Sunni inheritance.

### 15.8 Miscellaneous rules ⭐⭐

**Why Not as Critical**: This topic covers special rules for specific and less common scenarios in inheritance. While they are important for a complete understanding of the law's application in complex cases, they are not as foundational or frequently encountered as the main rules for the classes of heirs.

#### Detailed Explanation

In addition to the primary rules of distribution, Sunni inheritance law provides specific solutions for a number of special circumstances to ensure the rights of all potential heirs are protected.

**1. The Missing Person (`Mafqud`)**

This rule applies when a legal heir is missing and it is unknown whether they are alive or dead.

- **The Rule**: The law takes a cautious approach. A court will order that the share of the missing person be set aside and reserved. The rest of the estate is then distributed among the heirs who are present.
    
- **Procedure**: A time period is fixed by the court, waiting for news of the missing person. In Bangladesh, this is generally guided by **The Evidence Act, 1872**, which states that a person who has not been heard of for **seven years** by those who would naturally have heard of them is presumed to be dead.
    
- **Outcome**:
    
    - If the missing person returns within this period, they are given their reserved share.
        
    - If the period expires and they have not returned, they are legally declared dead, and their reserved share is redistributed among the other heirs as if the missing person had died before the original deceased.
        

**2. The Child in the Womb (`Haml`)**

This rule applies when an unborn child is a potential heir (e.g., the deceased's own child or grandchild).

- **The Rule**: The law protects the inheritance right of a child who is in the mother's womb at the time of the ancestor's death, provided the child is **born alive**.
    
- **Procedure**: The distribution of the estate is postponed until the child is born. A share is **reserved** in the estate for the unborn child. To be safe, the law reserves the largest possible share (usually the share of one son).
    
- **Outcome**:
    
    - If the child is born alive, they receive their rightful share, and any excess from the reserved portion is redistributed among the other heirs.
        
    - If the child is stillborn, they are considered to have never existed, and their reserved share is distributed among the other heirs.
        

**3. `Li'an` (Imprecation)** This is a special procedure where a husband formally accuses his wife of adultery in court. If he follows the procedure, and she denies it, the court issues a decree of divorce.

- **Effect on Inheritance**: The key consequence is that the paternity of the child whose legitimacy was questioned is **severed from the husband**. The child is declared illegitimate in relation to him. Therefore, there are **no mutual rights of inheritance** between that child and the father. The child can only inherit from its mother.
