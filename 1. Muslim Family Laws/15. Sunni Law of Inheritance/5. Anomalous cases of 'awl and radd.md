Of course. Let's cover the two special cases for adjusting inheritance shares.

### 15.5 Anomalous cases of 'awl and radd ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: These two doctrines are the essential mathematical tools for correctly resolving inheritance problems where the standard shares do not add up to a whole number. `Awl` and `Radd` are crucial for the practical application of inheritance law, ensuring that the entire estate is always distributed completely and proportionately among the entitled heirs.

#### Detailed Explanation

In some inheritance scenarios, after assigning the fixed fractional shares to the Qur'anic Heirs (Sharers), the sum of their shares may be either more than or less than the total estate. Sunni law provides two specific doctrines to resolve these anomalies.

---

### **1. The Doctrine of `Awl` (Increase)**

- **The Problem**: `Awl` is applied when the sum of the prescribed shares of all the Qur'anic Heirs is **greater than one** (e.g., the shares add up to 9/8). The estate is insufficient to give everyone their full Qur'anic share.
    
- **The Solution**: The shares of all the heirs are **proportionately reduced**. This is done through a simple mathematical adjustment:
    
    1. The fractional shares are converted to a common denominator.
        
    2. The numerators are added together.
        
    3. This sum of the numerators becomes the **new denominator**. The result is that each heir receives a slightly smaller fraction of the total estate, but the reduction is borne by everyone in proportion to their original share.
        
- **Example**: A woman dies leaving a **Husband** and **two Full Sisters**.
    
    - **Standard Shares**:
        
        - Husband's share = 1/2
            
        - Two Sisters' share = 2/3
            
    - **Calculation**: 1/2 + 2/3 = 3/6 + 4/6 = **7/6**. The total exceeds the estate.
        
    - **Applying `Awl`**: The new denominator becomes 7.
        
        - The Husband's new share is **3/7**.
            
        - The Sisters' new share is **4/7**. The estate is now correctly distributed.

### **2. The Doctrine of `Radd` (Return)**

- **The Problem**: `Radd` is applied in the opposite situation. The sum of the shares is **less than one**, AND there are **no Residuaries** (`Asabat`) to take the leftover portion.
    
- **The Solution**: The surplus or residue is "returned" and distributed among the Sharers in proportion to their original shares.
    
- **Crucial Exception**: The **husband or wife is NOT entitled** to participate in the `Radd` as long as there is any other Sharer or a member of the Distant Kindred class. The spouse's share remains fixed.
    
- **Example**: A person dies leaving only a **Mother** and a **single Daughter**.
    
    - **Standard Shares**:
        
        - Mother's share = 1/6
            
        - Daughter's share = 1/2
            
    - **Calculation**: 1/6 + 1/2 = 1/6 + 3/6 = **4/6**. There is a residue of **2/6**, and no Residuary to take it.
        
    - **Applying `Radd`**: The surplus is "returned" to the Mother and Daughter. This is done by making the sum of the numerators (4) the new denominator.
        
        - The Mother's new share is **1/4**.
            
        - The Daughter's new share is **3/4**. The entire estate is now distributed between them.
