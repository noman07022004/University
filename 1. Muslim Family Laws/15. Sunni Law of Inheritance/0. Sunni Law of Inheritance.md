## 📌 Sunni Law of Inheritance ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

>**Why Important**: The law of inheritance, known as `Ilm al-Fara'id` (the science of the ordained shares), is a core, complex, and defining feature of Muslim personal law. It is based on specific and detailed injunctions in the Qur'an. Disputes over inheritance are extremely common, and a thorough understanding of the classes of heirs, their shares, and the principles of distribution is essential for any student or practitioner of law in Bangladesh.

The Sunni law of inheritance is a sophisticated system for the compulsory distribution of a deceased Muslim's property. It is guided by several key principles:

1. ***Inheritance Opens Only on Death***: No individual has a "birthright" in a Muslim's property. The rights of the heirs come into existence only at the moment of the owner's death.
    
2. ***The Net Estate***: Inheritance is calculated on the **net estate**, which is the property that remains after the deceased's funeral expenses, debts, and any valid bequests (wills, up to 1/3 of the property) have been paid.
    
3. ***No Distinction in Property***: The rules of inheritance apply equally to all types of property, whether it is movable or immovable, ancestral or self-acquired.
    
4. ***No Doctrine of Representation (with a major statutory exception)***: In classical Sunni law, the principle of representation is not recognized. This means that if a son dies before his father, the son's children (the grandchildren) do not step into their father's shoes to inherit from their grandfather if he has other living sons. **However, this rule has been fundamentally altered in Bangladesh by Section 4 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961.**

### 🟢 Part I: Competence to Inherit and Disqualification

For a person to inherit, they must be related to the deceased through a legitimate blood tie (`nasab`) or a valid marriage (`sabab`). However, even a rightful heir can be disqualified on certain grounds:

#### 💠 Homicide: 
A person who caused the death of the deceased, whether intentionally or accidentally, is barred from inheriting from them.
    
#### 💠 Difference of Religion: 
A non-Muslim cannot inherit from a Muslim relative.

### 🟢 Part II: The Three Classes of Heirs

Sunni law divides the legal heirs into three main classes, who inherit in a specific order.

#### 1️⃣ Sharers (`Ashab al-Furud` or Qur'anic Heirs): 
These are the heirs for whom a specific fractional share of the estate is prescribed in the Qur'an. There are 12 Sharers in total (4 males and 8 females). They have the first priority and receive their shares first. Key examples include:
    
- **Husband**: Gets 1/2 if no children, 1/4 if there are children.
	
- **Wife**: Gets 1/4 if no children, 1/8 if there are children.
	
- **Father**: Gets 1/6.
	
- **Daughter**: Gets 1/2 (if only one and no son). Two or more daughters collectively get 2/3 (if no son).
	
- **Mother**: Gets 1/3 if no children, 1/6 if there are children.
        
#### 2️⃣ Residuaries (`Asabat` or Agnatic Heirs): 
These are typically male relatives in the male line of descent (agnates). They do not have a fixed share. Instead, they take whatever is **left of the residue** after the Sharers have been given their fixed shares. If there are no Sharers, the Residuaries take the entire estate. The son is the primary residuary.
    
#### 3️⃣ Distant Kindred (`Dhawu al-Arham` or Uterine Heirs): 
4These are blood relatives who are neither Sharers nor Residuaries (e.g., daughter's children, maternal uncle). They only inherit if there are absolutely no heirs from the first two classes.

### 🟢 Part III: The Doctrines of `Awl` (Increase) and `Radd` (Return)

Sometimes, the prescribed shares do not neatly add up. The law provides two mechanisms to handle these anomalies:

#### 💠 Doctrine of `Awl` (Increase): 
This is applied when the sum of the shares of the Sharers is **more than 1** (e.g., adds up to 9/8). In this case, the denominator of the shares is increased to match the sum of the numerators, which **proportionately reduces** the share of every heir.
    
#### 💠 Doctrine of `Radd` (Return): 
This is applied when the sum of the shares is **less than 1**, and there are no Residuaries to take the leftover portion. The surplus is "returned" to the Sharers (excluding the husband or wife) in proportion to their original shares.

### 🟢 Part IV: Crucial Statutory Provision - The MFLO, 1961

The single most important modern reform to the Sunni law of inheritance in Bangladesh is **Section 4 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961**.

#### 💠 The Problem It Solved: 
Under classical law, if a son died during his father's lifetime, that son's children (orphaned grandchildren) would receive no inheritance from their grandfather's property if the grandfather had other living sons.
    
#### 💠 The Statutory Solution: 
Section 4 introduces a form of representation. It states that the children of a predeceased son or daughter of the propositus shall receive, per stirpes, the share which their parent would have received had they been alive at the time the inheritance opened.
    
#### 💠 Effect: 
This landmark provision ensures that orphaned grandchildren are not left destitute and are entitled to inherit from their grandparents in place of their deceased parent.
