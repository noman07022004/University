### 15.4 Quranic heirs ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: The Qur'anic heirs, also known as **Sharers** or **`Ashab al-Furud`**, are the nucleus of the Islamic law of inheritance. Their shares are fixed directly by the Qur'an, and they have the first and highest priority in the distribution of the estate. Understanding their entitlements is non-negotiable for solving any inheritance problem.

#### Detailed Explanation

The Qur'anic Heirs are the individuals for whom a **specific, fixed fractional share** of the deceased's estate is prescribed in the Qur'an. They are the heirs of the first rank and are entitled to their shares before the rest of the estate is distributed. There are a total of 12 Sharers.

**The Principal Qur'anic Heirs and Their Shares**

Here are the shares of the most common and important Qur'anic heirs:

**1. The Spouses**

- **Husband**:
    
    - Receives **1/2** of the wife's estate if she has no children or son's children.
        
    - Receives **1/4** if she has children or son's children.
        
- **Wife**:
    
    - Receives **1/4** of the husband's estate if he has no children or son's children.
        
    - Receives **1/8** if he has children or son's children. (If there is more than one wife, they share this portion equally).
        

**2. The Parents**

- **Father**:
    
    - Receives **1/6** as a Sharer when the deceased has left a son or son's son. (He may also inherit more as a Residuary).
        
- **Mother**:
    
    - Receives **1/6** if the deceased has left children or if there are two or more siblings.
        
    - Receives **1/3** of the total estate if there are no children and no more than one sibling.
        

**3. The Descendants**

- **Daughter**:
    
    - If there is only **one daughter** and no son, she receives **1/2** of the estate.
        
    - If there are **two or more daughters** and no son, they collectively receive **2/3** of the estate, shared equally among them.
        
- **Son's Daughter** (in the absence of a daughter or son):
    
    - A single son's daughter gets **1/2**.
        
    - Two or more son's daughters collectively get **2/3**.
        

**Crucial Rule**: If a daughter co-exists with a son, she is no longer a Sharer. She becomes a **Residuary** along with the son, and they inherit the residue together under the rule "to the male, a portion equal to that of two females."

**The Principle of Exclusion (`Hajb`)** The presence of a closer heir can partially or wholly exclude a more remote heir. For example:

- The **Father** excludes the **Paternal Grandfather**.
    
- The **Mother** excludes all **Grandmothers**.
    
- The **Son** excludes the **Son's Daughter** from her fixed share (though she may inherit as a Residuary).
    

The process of inheritance always begins by identifying which Qur'anic heirs are present and not excluded, and then allocating their fixed shares from the net estate.
