Of course. Let's cover the final class of heirs.

### 15.7 Uterine heirs (Distant Kindred) ⭐⭐

**Why Not as Critical**: This topic covers the third and final class of heirs. They are important conceptually for completing the inheritance framework, but they inherit only in the rare circumstance that a person dies leaving no Qur'anic Heirs (Sharers) or Agnatic Heirs (Residuaries). Therefore, in practice, their claims are far less common than those of the first two classes.

#### Detailed Explanation

**Clarification of Terminology**

While the syllabus uses the term "Uterine heirs," in the technical language of Islamic inheritance, a "uterine brother" and "uterine sister" (who share the same mother but different fathers) are actually **Qur'anic Heirs (Sharers)**. The third and final class of heirs, which this topic addresses, is more accurately and broadly known as the **Distant Kindred (`Dhawu al-Arham`)**.

**Definition of Distant Kindred**

The **Distant Kindred** are all those blood relatives of the deceased who are **neither Qur'anic Heirs (Sharers) nor Agnatic Heirs (Residuaries)**. They are the heirs of the last resort.

**When Do They Inherit?**

The Distant Kindred are entitled to inherit only in one of two specific situations:

1. When there are absolutely **no Sharers and no Residuaries** left to inherit.
    
2. When the only surviving Sharer is the **husband or the wife**, and there are no Residuaries. In this case, the surviving spouse takes their prescribed Qur'anic share, and the entire remainder of the estate passes to the Distant Kindred.
    

The principle is that as long as there is any blood relative, however distant, the property will go to them before it escheats to the state.

**Examples of Distant Kindred**

This class is primarily composed of cognates (relatives through a female link). Examples include:

- **Descendants**: The children of daughters (e.g., a daughter's son) and the children of son's daughters.
    
- **Ascendants**: The maternal grandfather or the mother's father.
    
- **Collaterals**: The children of sisters, the daughters of brothers, and maternal uncles and aunts.
