Of course. Let's start with the general principles of Sunni inheritance law.

### 15.1 General Principles ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: These principles are the fundamental rules upon which the entire, complex structure of Sunni inheritance law is built. Understanding them is an absolute prerequisite for correctly applying the specific rules of distribution to different heirs. They define when inheritance applies, to what property, and the very nature of an heir's right.

#### Detailed Explanation

The Sunni law of inheritance, `Ilm al-Fara'id`, is governed by a set of clear and coherent principles derived from the primary sources of Islamic law.

**1. Inheritance Opens Only Upon Death** The right of an heir to inherit property comes into existence only at the precise moment of the ancestor's (`propositus`'s) death.

- **No Birthright**: Unlike some other legal systems, Muslim law does not recognize a "right by birth." A son, for example, has no legal right or interest in his father's property while the father is still alive.
    
- **Chance of Succession (`Spes Successionis`)**: An heir's potential right during the ancestor's lifetime is a mere "chance of succession." It is not a vested interest and cannot be sold, transferred, or willed away.
    

**2. The Net Estate is Heritable** The property that is available for distribution among the legal heirs is the **net estate** of the deceased. This is calculated by taking all the assets left by the deceased and then paying the following liabilities in order:

1. Funeral expenses (reasonable and moderate).
    
2. All debts and legal liabilities.
    
3. Any valid bequests (`Wasiyat` or will), which are limited to a maximum of **one-third (1/3)** of the remaining property. The property that is left after these deductions is the heritable estate.
    

**3. No Distinction Between Property Types** Muslim law makes no distinction between different kinds of property for the purpose of inheritance. The same rules apply to:

- Movable and immovable property.
    
- Ancestral and self-acquired property.
    

**4. No Doctrine of Representation (with a major statutory exception)** Classical Sunni law follows the rule that the **nearer in degree of relationship excludes the more remote**. This means the principle of representation is not recognized.

- **Classical Example**: If a grandfather has two sons, S1 and S2, and S1 dies during the grandfather's lifetime, S1's children (the grandchildren) would be completely excluded from the grandfather's property by their uncle, S2. They cannot "represent" their deceased father.
    
- **The Statutory Exception in Bangladesh**: This classical rule has been **abrogated** in Bangladesh by **Section 4 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961**. This law **introduces the principle of representation** for the children of predeceased sons and daughters, allowing them to inherit the share their parent would have received if they had been alive.
    

**5. Vested Inheritance** The moment an ancestor dies, their property immediately vests in their legal heirs in their respective shares. Even if the property has not been physically divided and distributed, the heirs become the legal owners of their shares. If an heir dies before the distribution is complete, their own vested share will pass on to their own legal heirs.
