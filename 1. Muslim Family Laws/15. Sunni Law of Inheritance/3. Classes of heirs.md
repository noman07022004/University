Of course. Let's cover the classification of heirs.

### 15.3 Classes of heirs ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: The classification of heirs is the absolute framework for the entire system of Sunni inheritance. All rules of distribution and exclusion are based on which class an heir belongs to. This fundamental categorization establishes the strict order of priority for distributing the deceased's estate and is a critical, foundational topic.

#### Detailed Explanation

To systematically distribute the estate of a deceased Sunni Muslim, the law divides all potential legal heirs into **three distinct classes**. These classes have a strict order of succession, meaning the second class only inherits if there is no one from the first, and the third class only inherits if there is no one from the first two.

**The Three Classes (in order of priority)**

**1. The Sharers (`Ashab al-Furud`)**

- **Who they are**: These are the heirs of the first rank, also known as **Qur'anic Heirs**. They are the individuals for whom a **specific, fixed fractional share** (like 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, etc.) of the estate is explicitly prescribed in the Qur'an.
    
- **Role in Distribution**: They have the first claim on the net estate. Their shares are paid out first.
    
- **The Heirs**: There are 12 Sharers in total: 4 males and 8 females. They include the **husband, wife, father, mother, daughter, and sister**, among others.
    

**2. The Residuaries (`Asabat`)**

- **Who they are**: These are the heirs who do not have a fixed share. They are typically male relatives connected to the deceased through an unbroken male line (agnates), such as a **son, grandson, brother, or paternal uncle**.
    
- **Role in Distribution**: Their role is to take the **residue** of the property.
    
    - If there are Sharers, the Residuaries take whatever is left after the Sharers have received their fixed shares.
        
    - If there are **no Sharers**, the Residuaries inherit the **entire estate**.
        
    - If the fixed shares of the Sharers exhaust the entire estate, the Residuaries get nothing.
        

**3. The Distant Kindred (`Dhawu al-Arham`)**

- **Who they are**: These are all other blood relatives of the deceased who are **neither Sharers nor Residuaries**.
    
- **Role in Distribution**: They are the heirs of the last resort. They are entitled to inherit **only if there are absolutely no heirs** belonging to either the Sharers or the Residuaries classes.
    
- **Examples**: This class includes relatives like the children of daughters (e.g., a daughter's son), the children of sisters, and maternal uncles and aunts.
    

**The Order of Distribution**

The distribution of the estate follows this strict order:

1. First, the **Sharers** are given their prescribed shares.
    
2. Next, the residue, if any, is given to the **Residuaries**.
    
3. Finally, if there are no Sharers or Residuaries, the entire estate goes to the **Distant Kindred**.
