Of course. Let's cover the next subtopic, the Agnatic Heirs.

### 15.6 Agnatic heirs ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: The Agnatic Heirs, also known as **Residuaries** or **`Asabat`**, are the second major class of heirs in Sunni law. They are the primary inheritors of the bulk of the estate, especially when the deceased leaves behind a son. Understanding their role and their strict order of priority is essential for correctly distributing the remainder of any estate.

#### Detailed Explanation

**Definition**

The **Agnatic Heirs** or **Residuaries (`Asabat`)** are the heirs who do not have a pre-determined fixed share in the inheritance. Instead, their right is to inherit the **residue** of the estate after the fixed shares of the Qur'anic Heirs (Sharers) have been distributed.

- **"Agnatic"** means they are related to the deceased through an **unbroken male line** (e.g., a son is related through his father, a paternal uncle is related through the father's father).
    

**Role in Inheritance**

The role of the Residuaries is simple but crucial:

1. If there are Sharers, the Residuaries take **whatever is left over**.
    
2. If there are **no Sharers**, the Residuaries inherit the **entire estate**.
    
3. If the shares of the Sharers completely exhaust the estate, the Residuaries receive **nothing**.
    

**Classification and Priority**

The Residuaries are themselves divided into classes, and the rule is that the **nearer in degree excludes the more remote**. The order of priority is:

1. **Descendants**: The **Son** is the primary Residuary, followed by the **Son's Son**, and so on. A son always excludes a grandson.
    
2. **Ascendants**: The **Father**, followed by the **Paternal Grandfather**. The father excludes the grandfather.
    
3. **Descendants of the Father**: The **Full Brother**, followed by the **Paternal Brother** (from the same father), then their male descendants in order.
    
4. **Descendants of the Paternal Grandfather**: The **Full Paternal Uncle**, followed by the **Paternal Uncle**, then their male descendants in order.
    

**Females as Residuaries**

While Residuaries are typically male agnates, certain female Qur'anic Heirs can become Residuaries in specific circumstances:

- **Residuary with another (`Asaba bi ghayriha`)**: This happens when a female Sharer co-exists with a male heir of the same degree. In this case, she stops being a Sharer and inherits as a Residuary with him according to the rule: **"to the male, a portion equal to that of two females."**
    
    - **Examples**:
        
        - A **Daughter** inheriting with a **Son**.
            
        - A **Full Sister** inheriting with a **Full Brother**.
