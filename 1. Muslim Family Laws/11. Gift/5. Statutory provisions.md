Of course. Let's cover the statutory provisions relating to pre-emption.

### 13.5 Statutory Provisions ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This is a very important topic because for agricultural land, which constitutes the majority of land in Bangladesh, the classical Muslim law of pre-emption has been largely superseded by a specific statutory law. A lawyer must know the procedure under this statute. Understanding the distinction between the statutory regime and the classical law is crucial for legal practice.

#### Detailed Explanation

In Bangladesh, the right of pre-emption is not governed by a single, uniform law. The applicable rules depend on the type of property being sold. The classical Muslim law of `Shuf'a` has been significantly modified and, in some cases, replaced by statutory provisions.

**1. Pre-emption for Agricultural Land**

The right of pre-emption concerning agricultural land is governed by **Section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 (SATA)**. This statute applies to all citizens of Bangladesh, regardless of their religion.

The statutory right under SATA is significantly different from the classical Muslim law of `Shuf'a`:

- **Who Can Claim?**
    
    - **Muslim Law**: Allows three classes of claimants (co-sharer, participator in immunities, neighbor).
        
    - **SATA**: The right is granted **only to a co-sharer tenant in the holding by inheritance**. The other two classes (participator and neighbor) have no right of pre-emption over agricultural land.
        
- **The Procedure (The "Demands")**:
    
    - **Muslim Law**: The strict and immediate performance of the two formal demands (`talabs`) is mandatory.
        
    - **SATA**: The `talabs` are **not required**. The procedure is to file an **application** in the appropriate court within a specified time limit (generally two months from the knowledge of the sale), depositing the purchase money and a percentage as compensation for the buyer.
        

**2. Pre-emption for Non-Agricultural Land**

For property that is not agricultural, such as houses and land in urban areas, the situation is different.

- **The Governing Law**: The classical **Muslim law of pre-emption (`Shuf'a`) continues to apply to Muslims** for this type of property.
    
- **Requirements**: Therefore, if a Muslim wishes to pre-empt the sale of an adjoining urban property, they must belong to one of the three recognized classes of `shafis` and must strictly perform the two `talabs` (immediate demand and the demand with witnesses).
    

**Summary of the Dual System**

|**Property Type**|**Applicable Law for Muslims**|**Who Can Claim?**|**"Demands" Required?**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Agricultural Land**|State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950|Only Co-sharers|No|
