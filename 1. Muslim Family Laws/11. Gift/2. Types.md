Of course. Let's cover the different types of gifts.

### 11.2 Types ⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: Understanding the different types of gifts is important for distinguishing between a simple, unconditional transfer (`Hiba`) and more complex transactions that may involve a return, a charitable motive, or the grant of limited rights. The specific type of gift determines its rules on revocability and its ultimate legal character.

#### Detailed Explanation

While the simple, unconditional gift (`Hiba`) is the most common form, Muslim law recognizes several distinct types of voluntary transfers, each with its own characteristics and legal consequences.

**1. `Hiba` (Simple Gift)** This is the standard type of gift, as previously defined.

- **Nature**: A complete and unconditional transfer of the ownership of property without any return or consideration.
    
- **Key Feature**: It is completed by the three essential elements (declaration, acceptance, and delivery of possession). It is revocable in certain situations (e.g., a gift to a stranger) but irrevocable if made to a close relative within the prohibited degrees.
    

**2. `Hiba-bil-iwaz` (Gift with a Return)** This is a transaction that is structured as a gift but functions more like a sale.

- **Nature**: It consists of **two separate and distinct acts of giving**:
    
    1. First, a donor makes an initial gift (`Hiba`) to a donee.
        
    2. Second, the donee, in a separate and voluntary act, gives something back to the original donor. This return is called the `iwaz`.
        
- **Legal Effect**: Once the `iwaz` is delivered, the transaction is complete and becomes **irrevocable**. It is then treated legally like a sale, and the strict rules of delivery of possession for the initial gift are relaxed.
    

**3. `Hiba-ba-shart-ul-iwaz` (Gift with a Stipulation for a Return)** This is a gift made as a single transaction but with a condition attached.

- **Nature**: The donor gives the property with the **express condition (`shart`)** that the donee must give something specific in return.
    
- **Legal Effect**:
    
    - Initially, it is a `Hiba` and requires the delivery of possession to be valid.
        
    - The gift remains **revocable** until the stipulated return is paid.
        
    - Once the return is paid, the gift becomes **irrevocable** and takes on the character of a sale.
        

**4. `Sadaqa` (Charitable Gift)** This is a gift made not out of personal affection, but for a religious or spiritual purpose.

- **Nature**: A transfer of property made with the intention of earning **religious merit** (`thawab`), typically given to the poor or for a religious/charitable cause.
    
- **Legal Effect**: It requires the same three essentials as a `Hiba`. However, once a `Sadaqa` is completed by delivery of possession, it is **absolutely irrevocable**.
    

**5. `Ariyat` (Grant of a License)** This is not a gift of the property itself, but a grant of the right to use it.

- **Nature**: The owner of a property grants another person the right to use or enjoy the benefits and profits (`manafi`) of the property without transferring ownership.
    
- **Legal Effect**: An `Ariyat` is essentially a gratuitous loan of the use of a property. As ownership is not transferred, the grant is **revocable at any time** at the will of the owner.
    
    - **Example**: Allowing a friend to live in your spare apartment rent-free is an `Ariyat`, not a `Hiba` of the apartment.
