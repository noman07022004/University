### 11.4 Undivided property ⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This is a technical but important topic in the law of gifts. It deals with the special rules for gifting a co-owned property (`Mushaa`), which presents a challenge to the essential requirement of "delivery of possession." Understanding the classical rule and its numerous modern exceptions is key to determining the validity of such gifts.

#### Detailed Explanation

**The Concept of `Mushaa`**

**`Mushaa`** is an Arabic term for an **undivided share** in a property that is jointly or commonly owned by two or more people. The gift of such a share is known as a gift of `Mushaa`. For example, if two brothers jointly own a single plot of land, each brother's half-share is a `Mushaa`.

**The General Rule (Hanafi School)**

The classical Hanafi school of law, which is followed in Bangladesh, has a specific rule regarding such gifts:

- **The Rule**: A gift of a `Mushaa` in a property that is **capable of being divided** is considered **irregular (`fasid`)**, unless the share is partitioned (divided off) and then delivered to the donee.
    
- **Rationale**: This rule is a direct extension of the strict requirement of **delivery of possession (`qabza`)**. The jurists reasoned that it is impossible to deliver complete and exclusive possession of a share that has not yet been separated from the rest of the property. The rule was designed to prevent uncertainty about the subject matter of the gift.
    
- **Example**: Ali and Omar are co-owners of a 10-katha plot of land. If Ali wants to gift his 5-katha share to his son, the strict rule requires him to first legally partition the land, have a specific 5-katha portion demarcated, and then deliver possession of that specific portion to his son.
    

**Exceptions to the Rule of `Mushaa`**

The strictness of the `Mushaa` rule has been significantly relaxed over time by judicial decisions, and it is now subject to several important exceptions. A gift of an undivided share is now considered **valid** in the following situations:

1. **Where the Property is Indivisible**: If the property is of such a nature that it cannot be divided without destroying its utility, a gift of a share in it is valid. For example, a gift of a share in a staircase or a well.
    
2. **Where the Gift is to a Co-sharer**: If the donor gifts their share in a property to a person who is already a co-owner of that same property, the gift is valid without prior partition.
    
3. **Gift of Shares in a Company**: A gift of shares in a commercial company is valid without division.
    
4. **Modern Approach: Sufficient Transfer of Control**: The modern and most widely applied exception is that a gift of `Mushaa` will be held valid if the donor does everything in their power to divest themselves of ownership and puts the donee in a position to take possession of their share. This often involves a form of **constructive possession**.
    
    - **Example**: If a co-owner gifts his undivided share of a rented building to his daughter and directs the tenants to pay her proportionate share of the rent, this is considered a valid delivery of possession, and the gift is upheld.
        

In modern practice, courts are reluctant to invalidate a gift on the technical ground of `Mushaa` if the donor's intention was clear and they took reasonable steps to transfer control to the donee.
