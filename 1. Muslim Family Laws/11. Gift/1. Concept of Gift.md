Of course. Let's cover the foundational concept of Gift (`Hiba`).

### 11.1 Concept ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: The concept of `Hiba` is the absolute foundation of the Muslim law of gifts. It is defined by three indispensable elements that are strictly required for a gift to be valid. The requirement of "delivery of possession" is particularly crucial and is a frequent point of contention in legal disputes, making this a fundamental and critical topic.

#### Detailed Explanation

In Islamic law, a **Gift (`Hiba`)** is a voluntary, immediate, and unconditional transfer of the ownership of a specified property from one person (the donor) to another (the donee), made without any payment or consideration (`iwad`).

The concept is not based on formalities like writing or registration but on the fulfillment of **three essential elements or conditions**. The absence of any one of these three elements will render the gift invalid.

### **The Three Essential Elements of `Hiba`**

**1. Declaration (`Ijab`)** This is the first step, where the donor (`wahib`) makes a clear and unambiguous declaration of their intention to make a gift.

- **Form**: The declaration can be made **orally** or in **writing**. An oral gift is perfectly valid under Muslim law.
    
- **Intent**: The donor must clearly express the intention to immediately and completely transfer ownership of the property to the donee. A declaration that promises a gift in the future is not a valid `Hiba`; it is merely a promise to make a gift, which is not legally enforceable.
    

**2. Acceptance (`Qabul`)** This is the acceptance of the gift by the donee (`mawhub lahu`).

- **Form**: Acceptance can be **express** (e.g., by saying "I accept") or **implied** by conduct (e.g., by taking possession of the gifted property).
    
- **On Behalf of Minors**: If the donee is a minor or a person of unsound mind, acceptance must be given on their behalf by their legal guardian (typically the father or paternal grandfather).
    

**3. Delivery of Possession (`Qabza`)** This is the **most critical and indispensable element** of a `Hiba`. A gift is not complete in the eyes of the law until possession of the subject matter has been transferred from the donor to the donee.

- **The Rule**: A famous legal maxim states, "A `Hiba` is not valid without `qabza`." Until possession is delivered, the gift is revocable and incomplete.
    
- **Nature of Delivery**: Delivery can be:
    
    - **Actual**: Physically handing over the property, such as giving the keys to a house, delivering a car, or handing over an ornament.
        
    - **Constructive**: Any symbolic act by the donor that places the donee in a position of control over the property. For example, if the gifted property is rented out, the donor can direct the tenant to start paying rent to the donee.
        
- **Core Principle**: The donor must do everything in their power to divest themselves of ownership and control and put the donee in a position where they can exercise full rights as the new owner.
    

**Exemption from Statutory Formalities** It is crucial to understand that under **Section 129 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882**, the rules of Muslim gifts are exempt from the provisions of that Act. This means that unlike other communities, a Muslim **does not need a registered written deed** to make a valid gift of immovable property. An oral gift that fulfills the three essential conditions above is perfectly valid and legal.
