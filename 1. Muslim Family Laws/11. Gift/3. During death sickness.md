Of course. Let's cover the special rules for gifts made during death sickness.

### 11.3 During death sickness ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This is a very important topic as it represents a crucial exception to the normal rules of `Hiba`. A gift made during death sickness (`Marz-ul-Maut`) is not treated as a regular gift but is governed by the strict rules of a will (`wasiyat`). This is a key legal principle designed to protect the fixed shares of legal heirs from being altered by a donor in their final moments.

#### Detailed Explanation

**Concept of `Marz-ul-Maut`**

**`Marz-ul-Maut`** translates to "sickness of death." A gift made during `Marz-ul-Maut` is a death-bed gift. It is a gift made by a person who is suffering from an illness that ultimately leads to their death, under the apprehension that they will not recover.

This type of gift is a unique legal hybrid. It is made between living persons (`inter vivos`) like a regular gift, but it is treated by the law as a testamentary disposition (like a **will**).

**Conditions for a `Marz-ul-Maut` Gift**

For a gift to be classified as a death-bed gift, three conditions must be met:

1. **Apprehension of Death**: The illness must be of such a nature that it causes a genuine and imminent fear of death in the donor's mind.
    
2. **External Signs of Sickness**: There should be some external indicators that the person is seriously ill (e.g., they are bedridden).
    
3. **Death of the Donor**: The donor must actually die from that specific illness. If the donor unexpectedly recovers, the transaction is treated as a regular, valid `Hiba` (provided possession was delivered).
    

**Legal Rules and Restrictions**

Because a gift made during death sickness is treated as a will, it is subject to the two fundamental limitations that govern Islamic wills:

**1. The One-Third (1/3) Limit** A person can only dispose of a maximum of **one-third (1/3)** of their total property through a will. Therefore, a gift made during `Marz-ul-Maut` is only valid up to one-third of the donor's net estate (after all debts and funeral expenses have been paid). A gift exceeding this one-third limit is invalid unless the donor's **other legal heirs give their consent** after the donor's death.

**2. Prohibition on Gifting to an Heir** A will made in favor of a legal heir is invalid. Similarly, a gift made during `Marz-ul-Maut` to a person who is also a **legal heir** of the donor is **invalid**. Such a gift can only be validated if all the **other legal heirs provide their consent** after the donor's death.

**Rationale**: The purpose of these strict rules is to uphold the sanctity of the Qur'anic laws of inheritance. They prevent a person from using a death-bed gift to unfairly favor one heir over another or to give away a large portion of their property, thereby depriving the legally mandated heirs of their fixed shares.

While it is governed by the rules of a will, a `Marz-ul-Maut` gift still requires the delivery of possession to the donee to be completed.
