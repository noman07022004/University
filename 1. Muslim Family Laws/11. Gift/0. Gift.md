## 📌 Gift ⭐⭐⭐⭐

>**Why Important**: The law of gifts, or **`Hiba`**, is a significant part of Muslim personal law that governs the transfer of property between living persons without any consideration. Its rules are distinct from and, in some cases, override the general property laws of the country, such as the Transfer of Property Act. Understanding the unique and essential requirements of a valid `Hiba`, especially the crucial element of "delivery of possession," is vital.

---

In Islamic law, a **`Hiba`** is a voluntary, immediate, and absolute transfer of the ownership of existing property from one person, the **donor (`wahib`)**, to another, the **donee (`mawhub lahu`)**, without any consideration (`iwad`).

For a `Hiba` to be valid, **three essential elements** must be fulfilled:

1. **Declaration (`Ijab`)**: A clear and unambiguous declaration by the donor of their intention to make a gift.
    
2. **Acceptance (`Qabul`)**: An acceptance of the gift, either express or implied, by or on behalf of the donee.
    
3. **Delivery of Possession (`Qabza`)**: The actual or constructive delivery of the subject matter of the gift to the donee, allowing the donee to exercise full control over it. This is the most critical element.
    

An oral gift is perfectly valid. Writing or registration is not necessary, provided these three elements are present.

### 🟢 Part I: Types and Special Forms of Gift

While a simple `Hiba` is the most common form, the law recognizes other types of transfers:

- **`Sadaqa`**: This is a gift made with the intention of earning religious merit, typically for a charitable purpose. Unlike `Hiba`, its primary motive is a reward from God.
    
- **`Hiba-bil-iwaz` (Gift with a return)**: This is a transaction consisting of two separate acts of giving. The donor makes a gift, and the donee, in return, gives something back. Once the return is made, the transaction is treated like a sale and becomes irrevocable.
    
- **Gift During Death Sickness (`Marz-ul-Maut`)**: This is a special type of gift made by a person on their deathbed, suffering from an illness that results in their death.
    
    - **Nature**: It is a hybrid of a gift and a will. It takes effect as a gift if the person recovers but is treated as a **will (`wasiyat`)** if they die from that illness.
        
    - **The Rule**: As it is treated like a will, it is only valid up to **one-third (1/3)** of the donor's total property after the payment of debts and funeral expenses. Any amount exceeding one-third is invalid unless the other legal heirs give their consent. Similarly, a gift made to a legal heir during death sickness is invalid unless the other heirs consent. This rule prevents a person from using deathbed gifts to alter the fixed Qur'anic shares of inheritance.

### 🟢 Part II: The Subject Matter of a Gift (The Rule of `Mushaa`)

A donor can gift any property that they own. However, a special rule applies to gifts of undivided property.

- **`Mushaa`**: This refers to an undivided share in a property that is capable of being divided (e.g., a co-owned piece of land).
    
- **The Classical Rule**: A gift of a `Mushaa` is considered irregular (`fasid`) unless the specific share is divided off and delivered to the donee. The rationale is to avoid uncertainty in the delivery of possession.
    
- **Modern Exceptions**: This rule has been significantly relaxed by courts, and a gift of an undivided share is now generally considered valid if the donor transfers possession of their share to the extent that it is possible. The rule does not apply at all if the property is indivisible (e.g., a staircase) or in the case of a gift of shares in a company.

### 🟢 Part III: Statutory Provisions in Bangladesh

This is a critical point of law that distinguishes `Hiba` from other property transfers.

- **The Transfer of Property Act, 1882**: Section 123 of this Act requires that a gift of immovable property must be made through a **registered written instrument** signed by the donor.
    
- **The Exemption for Muslim Law**: However, **Section 129** of the same Act explicitly states that the rules in that chapter **do not affect any rule of Muhammadan Law**.
    
- **The Result**: The formal requirements of the Transfer of Property Act **do not apply to a Muslim `Hiba`**. A Muslim can make a completely valid gift of even a large property **orally**, without any writing or registration, as long as the three essential elements (declaration, acceptance, and delivery of possession) are proven.
    

While registration is not required for the validity of a `Hiba`, it is always highly advisable to execute a registered deed of gift to serve as clear proof of the transaction and to prevent future disputes.
