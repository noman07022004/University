## üìå Stipulations of Marriage ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: This topic is foundational to the practical application of Muslim family law. It establishes that a Muslim marriage (`Nikah`) is fundamentally a **civil contract**, not a sacrament. Understanding this contractual nature is the key to everything that follows. Furthermore, knowing how stipulations can be added to this contract is crucial for modern legal practice, as it allows parties to customize their marital rights and obligations, most notably empowering the wife with the right of delegated divorce (`Talaq-i-Tafwid`).

In Islamic law, marriage, or **`Nikah`**, is a solemn pact, but its legal framework is that of a civil contract (`'Aqd`). This contractual nature is its most defining feature, distinguishing it from the concept of marriage as a holy sacrament in other religious traditions. The primary legal objectives of this contract are to legitimize sexual relations between a man and a woman and to establish the legitimacy and parentage of their offspring.

Because it is a contract, it is formed through offer and acceptance, requires consideration, and creates a set of rights and duties. More importantly, this framework allows the parties, within certain limits defined by the Shari'ah, to add specific conditions or stipulations (`shurut`) to their marital agreement, thereby tailoring it to their specific needs and circumstances.

### üü¢ Part I: The Contractual Nature of Marriage

The treatment of `Nikah` as a contract is evident from its essential elements, which mirror those of any other civil contract in Islamic law:

##### üí† Offer and Acceptance (`Ijab wa Qabul`): 
The marriage is concluded by a clear and unambiguous offer from one party (e.g., "I have married you") and a corresponding acceptance by the other party (e.g., "I have accepted"). These must occur in a single session, in the presence of the required witnesses, to ensure there is no ambiguity about the parties' intent.
    
##### üí† Capacity to Contract (`Ahliyyah`): 
The parties must be legally competent. This requires them to be of sound mind and to have attained the age of puberty (`bulugh`), which is the age of majority for marriage purposes under classical Islamic law.
    
##### üí† Free Consent (`Ridha`): 
The consent of both parties must be genuine and free from any coercion (`ikrah`), fraud (`tadlis`), or undue influence. The consent of a woman is particularly vital; a famous Hadith states, "A previously married woman cannot be married without her command, and a virgin cannot be married without her permission."
    
##### üí† Consideration (`Mahr` or Dower): 
`Mahr` is a mandatory payment or gift that the husband must give to the wife. It is not a "bride price" paid to her family, but a right of the wife herself, symbolizing the husband's commitment and respect. It is an essential legal effect of the marriage contract. If no `Mahr` is specified, the marriage is still valid, but the law imposes a "proper dower" (`mahr al-mithl`) based on the status of the wife's family.

While `Nikah` is a contract, it is one of a special nature. It has a devotional aspect (`'ibadah`) and is subject to rules imposed by the Shari'ah that the parties cannot contract out of. For instance, they cannot stipulate that they will be free to have extra-marital relations or that the husband has no duty to maintain the wife. The core rights and obligations are divinely ordained and form the unalterable substance of the contract.

### üü¢ Part II: Nature and Types of Stipulations (`Shurut`)

A stipulation (`shart`) is a condition inserted into the marriage contract, typically in the official marriage deed (`Nikahnama`), which grants a right or imposes an obligation not automatically conferred by the law itself. The validity of such stipulations is a subject of detailed juristic analysis, particularly within the Hanafi school, which classifies them into three categories.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Valid and Enforceable Stipulations (`Sahih`)

These are conditions that are not contrary to the fundamental principles or objectives of marriage and are consistent with the Shari'ah. A valid stipulation is legally binding.

- **Most Important Example: Delegated Divorce (`Talaq-i-Tafwid`)**: This is a stipulation where the **husband delegates his power of divorce to his wife**, either absolutely or conditionally. The wife may stipulate that she shall have the right to pronounce divorce on herself if a certain condition is met. Common examples include stipulations that she can exercise this right if:
    
    - The husband takes a second wife.
        
    - He fails to maintain her for a specified period.
        
    - He physically abuses her.
        
    - He requires her to live outside her native city.
        
    
    This is the single most important type of stipulation in modern practice and is explicitly provided for in **Column 18 of the standardized `Nikahnama` in Bangladesh**.
    

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Void Stipulations (`Batil`)

These are conditions that are fundamentally inconsistent with the nature of marriage or are expressly forbidden by Islamic law. In such cases, the **stipulation itself is void and has no legal effect, but the marriage contract remains valid.** The law simply ignores the prohibited condition.

- **Examples of Void Stipulations**:
    
    - A condition that the husband will have no duty to provide maintenance (`nafaqa`) to the wife.
        
    - A condition that the wife will receive no dower (`mahr`).
        
    - A condition that the husband and wife will not live together or establish a marital home.
        
    - A condition that the marriage is for a temporary, fixed period (which would constitute a `mut'a` marriage, invalid under Sunni law).
        

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Irregular/Invalidating Stipulations (`Fasid`)

This is a rarer category. It refers to a stipulation that is so fundamentally flawed that it renders the entire contract irregular (`fasid`). This typically involves a condition that creates uncertainty about the very existence of the marriage itself, for example, making the marriage contingent upon an unknown future event.

In summary, the contractual framework of Muslim marriage provides a unique combination of divine regulation and personal autonomy. While the core tenets of the marriage are fixed by the Shari'ah, the system of stipulations allows parties to proactively define and protect their interests, making the marriage contract a dynamic legal instrument.
