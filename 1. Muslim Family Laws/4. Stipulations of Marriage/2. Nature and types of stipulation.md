Of course. As this is a key practical area of marriage law, here is a focused, detailed explanation of the nature and types of stipulations.

### 4.2 Nature and types of stipulation ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This topic provides the legal framework for personalizing a Muslim marriage contract. It details how parties can add conditions (`shurut`) to protect their interests and secure rights beyond the standard effects of the marriage. Understanding the different types of stipulations—valid, void, and invalidating—is of immense practical importance, especially concerning the wife's right to delegated divorce (`Talaq-i-Tafwid`) as provided in the modern `Nikahnama`.

#### Detailed Explanation

A **stipulation (`shart`)** in the context of a marriage contract is an additional condition agreed upon by the parties that is not an intrinsic legal requirement of the marriage itself. The general principle in Islamic contract law, as stated in a Prophetic tradition, is that "Muslims are bound by their conditions." This allows for a degree of freedom of contract, enabling the parties to customize their marital agreement.

However, this freedom is not absolute. The validity of a stipulation depends on its compatibility with the core principles and objectives (`maqasid`) of Islamic marriage. The Hanafi school, which is most relevant to Bangladesh, classifies these stipulations into three main categories.

#### 1. Valid Stipulations (`Shart Sahih`)

A stipulation is valid and legally enforceable if it is reasonable and does not contradict the spirit or the essential effects of the marriage contract. If a party breaches a valid stipulation, the other party has the right to seek legal recourse, which often includes the right to a judicial dissolution of the marriage (`faskh`).

**Examples of Valid Stipulations:**

- **Delegated Divorce (`Talaq-i-Tafwid`)**: This is the most significant type. The wife stipulates that she will possess the authority to pronounce a divorce on herself under specific circumstances. For instance, she can be delegated the right to divorce if the husband:
    
    - Marries a second wife without her consent.
        
    - Fails to provide maintenance for a certain period.
        
    - Is absent for an extended time.
        
    - Commits physical abuse. This stipulation does not take away the husband's right to divorce but grants a parallel right to the wife. This is a key feature of the standard `Nikahnama` in Bangladesh (Column 18).
        
- **Restriction on Polygyny**: The wife stipulates that the husband shall not marry another woman while he is married to her. If the husband breaches this condition and takes a second wife, the second marriage would still be legally valid (assuming it meets all other requirements), but the first wife would have the right to seek a divorce based on the breach of this valid stipulation.
    
- **Right to a Separate Residence**: The wife stipulates that she will not be required to live with her in-laws and will be provided with a separate house. This is a perfectly valid and enforceable condition.
    
- **Monetary Benefit**: The wife stipulates a right to a fixed monthly personal allowance, distinct from her right to basic maintenance (`nafaqa`).

#### 2. Void Stipulations (`Shart Batil`)

A stipulation is void if it directly negates one of the core, legally mandated effects of a marriage. In this case, the legal principle is that the **stipulation is struck down as null, but the marriage contract itself remains valid and binding.** The law simply severs and ignores the illegal condition.

**Examples of Void Stipulations:**

- A stipulation that the wife will not be entitled to any dower (`mahr`). (This is void; a proper dower will be legally imposed).
    
- A stipulation that the husband is not obligated to provide maintenance (`nafaqa`). (This is void; the duty of maintenance remains).
    
- A stipulation that the spouses will not inherit from each other. (This is void; mutual inheritance rights are an automatic effect of a valid marriage).
    
- A stipulation granting either party the freedom to engage in extra-marital relations. (This is void as it is contrary to the very definition of marriage).

#### 3. Invalidating Stipulations (`Shart Fasid`)

A stipulation is classified as `fasid` (irregular or invalidating) if it is so fundamentally contrary to the nature of marriage that it vitiates the contract itself. This type of stipulation negates the primary objectives for which marriage was instituted.

**Legal Effect**: Both the **stipulation and the marriage contract are rendered irregular (`fasid`)**.

**Examples of Invalidating Stipulations:**

- **Stipulation of a Time Limit**: A condition that the marriage will automatically dissolve after a specified period (e.g., one month, one year). This effectively turns the marriage into a temporary union (`mut'a`), which is prohibited under Sunni (Hanafi) law and invalidates the contract.
    
- **Stipulation Negating Marital Relations**: A condition that the parties will never consummate the marriage. This is seen as negating a primary purpose of `Nikah` and would render the contract irregular.
