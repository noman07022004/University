## 📚 **7. Dower (Mahr)**

### 🔑 **Main Idea**

**Dower** (_Mahr_) is a **mandatory gift or payment** that the husband gives to the wife as part of the marriage contract.  
It is **not a bride price** — it’s the wife’s exclusive right under Sharia, symbolizing respect, security, and the seriousness of the contract.

### 🧩 **Subtopics**

---

### **7.1 Concept**

✅ **What is Mahr?**

- A legal obligation on the husband — it may be money, property, or any valuable asset.
    
- It belongs entirely to the wife — she can spend, save, or gift it freely.
    
- It is evidence of the husband’s commitment and responsibility.
    

---

### **7.2 Amount of Dower**

✅ **How much?**

- No fixed limit in Sharia — it must be reasonable.
    
- Must be agreed upon freely by both parties.
    
- If not specified at the time of marriage, _proper dower_ (_Mahr-i-Misl_) applies — based on what similar women in her family receive.

### **7.3 Types of Dower**

✅ **Two main types:**

1️⃣ **Prompt Dower (Mu’ajjal)**

- Payable immediately upon demand — wife can refuse cohabitation until paid.
    

2️⃣ **Deferred Dower (Muwajjal)**

- Payable later — on divorce or husband’s death.
    

👉 Often, dower is partly prompt and partly deferred.

### **7.4 Right on Non-Payment**

✅ **Legal protection**

- Wife may refuse conjugal rights if prompt dower is unpaid.
    
- She can sue to recover dower.
    
- On husband’s death, unpaid dower becomes a debt on the estate — wife ranks as a creditor.
    

---

### **7.5 Widow’s Claim**

✅ **If the husband dies**

- The unpaid deferred dower must be paid first from his property — before heirs inherit.
    
- The widow can keep possession of her deceased husband’s property (_right of retention_) until the dower is paid — under Hanafi law.
    

---

### **7.6 Limitation**

✅ **Time limit for claim**

- Governed by Limitation Act — generally:
    
    - 3 years from date of demand/refusal.
        
    - Or 3 years from husband’s death/divorce.
        
- Delay does not cancel the right — only the court suit if limitation expires.
    

---

## ⚖️ **Modern Perspective**

- Dower is a safeguard for women — it acts as financial security especially in cases of divorce or widowhood.
    
- Modern courts protect wives’ rights to claim dower through statutory frameworks.

## ✅ **Key Takeaway**

_Mahr_ is a powerful tool to protect a wife’s financial independence — it proves that marriage is a **contract with enforceable rights**, not just a social custom.
