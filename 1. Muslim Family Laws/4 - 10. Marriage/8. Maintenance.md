## 📚 **8. Maintenance**

### 🔑 **Main Idea**

In Muslim Family Law, **maintenance** (_Nafaqa_) means the husband’s **legal duty** to provide for the wife and dependents — covering **food, clothing, shelter, healthcare, and basic needs**.  
This duty reflects the husband’s responsibility and the wife’s **right** — and it’s also supported by statutory laws in Bangladesh.

### **8.1 Husband’s Duty**

✅ **Basic obligation**

- The husband must maintain:
    
    - His wife,
        
    - Minor children,
        
    - Parents (in some interpretations).
        
- Even if the wife is wealthy — her wealth does not reduce his duty.
    
- Must maintain her **reasonably**, according to **his means** and her **social status**.
    

✅ **When duty exists**

- Wife must be obedient and faithful — unjustified refusal of cohabitation may limit the claim.
    
- If the husband neglects or refuses → the wife can sue for maintenance.

### **8.2 Statutory Rights of Maintenance**

✅ **Legal backing**

- Under the **Pita-Matar Bharan-Poshan Ain, 2013** (Parents Maintenance Act) — children must maintain elderly parents.
    
- The **Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961** — gives wives stronger enforcement rights.
    
- Family Courts can order payment and enforce arrears.
    

✅ **Scope**

- Courts may fix **monthly allowance**.
    
- May include past unpaid maintenance.

### **8.3 During Iddat**

✅ **Iddat = waiting period**

- After divorce or husband’s death, the wife must observe **iddat** — a period of waiting before remarriage.
    
- The husband (or his estate) must maintain the wife during **iddat of divorce**.
    
- For **widow**, she has inheritance rights but not maintenance beyond iddat.
    

✅ **Key rule**

- If divorced while pregnant → maintenance continues until childbirth.
    

---

## ⚖️ **Modern Perspective**

- Maintenance laws aim to protect vulnerable family members, especially wives who are economically dependent.
    
- Courts ensure that husbands fulfill this duty — or face legal consequences.

## ✅ **Key Takeaway**

Maintenance is a **binding duty**, not charity — it keeps family stability and protects the financial security of wives, children, and (sometimes) parents.
