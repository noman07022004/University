## 📚 **4. Stipulations of Marriage**

### 🔑 **Main Idea**

Marriage (_Nikah_) in Islam is fundamentally a **civil contract**, not just a sacred ritual.  
It comes with rights, duties — and **stipulations (conditions)** that the parties can agree on _before_ or _during_ the marriage contract.

These stipulations help protect the rights of husband and wife, clarify expectations, and ensure fairness under both Sharia and statutory law.

### **4.1 Contractual Nature of Marriage**

✅ **Marriage as a Contract**

- Islam treats marriage as a _civil agreement_ (_Aqd_).
    
- The Quran and Sunnah view it as a solemn pledge (_Mithaq Ghaliz_) — serious and binding.
    
- It must fulfill core contract principles: **offer, acceptance, consent, capacity, witnesses**.
    

✅ **Key Contractual Elements**

- **Consent:** Both parties must consent freely.
    
- **Mahr (Dower):** Mandatory gift from husband to wife.
    
- **Conditions:** May include extra clauses that do not contradict Sharia.
    

✅ **Why Contractual?**

- Distinguishes Islamic marriage from sacramental views (like Christian sacrament of marriage).
    
- Means parties can negotiate terms _before_ marriage.
    
- Makes enforcement possible in courts.

### **4.2 Nature and Types of Stipulation**

✅ **What is a Stipulation?**

- A _shart_ (condition) that modifies, adds, or clarifies rights/obligations.
    
- Example: Wife may stipulate that husband cannot take a second wife without her consent.
    

✅ **Valid Stipulations**

- Must not violate Quranic rules or established Sharia principles.
    
- Example: Wife may stipulate the right to work, live separately from in-laws, or fix where to reside.
    

✅ **Invalid Stipulations**

- Any clause that goes against _the essence_ of marriage or Islamic law is void.
    
- E.g. A stipulation saying husband will never pay dower is invalid — because _mahr_ is mandatory.
    
- E.g. A stipulation that makes divorce impossible forever is invalid.
    

✅ **Enforcement**

- Courts in Bangladesh can enforce valid stipulations.
    
- If husband breaches, wife may have grounds for divorce or other legal remedies.

## ⚖️ **Modern Context**

- The **Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961** recognizes these conditions in the marriage contract (_Nikahnama_).
    
- Many countries encourage registering stipulations to protect women’s rights.
    
- Judges often check whether stipulations were agreed willingly.

## ✅ **Key Takeaway**

A Muslim marriage is not vague — it’s a _binding contract with customizable conditions_.  
Understanding stipulations means:

- You can advise clients how to protect their rights.
    
- You can spot illegal or unfair clauses.
    
- You can interpret what courts can enforce under statutory law.
