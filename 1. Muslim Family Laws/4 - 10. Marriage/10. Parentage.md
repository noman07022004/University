### ✅ **Key Points**

**1️⃣ Legitimacy:**

- In Islamic law, legitimacy is linked to valid marriage (_nikah_).
    
- A child born within lawful wedlock or within _iddat_ after divorce is legitimate.
    
- Presumption of legitimacy can be challenged only in rare cases (e.g., physical impossibility).
    
- Illegitimate children (_walad al-zina_) have no legal claim to inheritance from biological father under classical law, but the mother’s lineage remains.

**2️⃣ Guardianship (_Wilayah_):**

- _Guardianship of person_: Taking care of minor’s upbringing, marriage, and welfare.
    
- _Guardianship of property_: Managing minor’s property/wealth.
    
- Father is primary natural guardian → then paternal grandfather → then court-appointed guardian.
    
- Mother usually has no right of guardianship of property but has custody.

**3️⃣ Custodial Care (_Hizanat_):**

- Mother has first right to custody of minor children (esp. young ones & daughters) until a certain age.
    
- After that, custody may shift to father or paternal relatives.
    
- Custody rights depend on the mother’s character and living conditions.
    
- Welfare of the child is the paramount principle — courts can intervene if needed.

**4️⃣ Statutory Laws:**

- Guardians and Wards Act 1890 (still relevant).
    
- Courts can appoint or remove guardians for welfare of the minor.
    
- Some modern statutory changes accommodate mothers’ stronger role in custody.
