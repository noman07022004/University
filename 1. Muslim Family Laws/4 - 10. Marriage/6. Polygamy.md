## 📚 **6. Polygamy**

### 🔑 **Main Idea**

Polygamy in Islam means a Muslim man may marry more than one wife **under specific conditions** — but it is _not_ an unrestricted right.  
It is regulated by **Quranic principles** and **modern statutory laws** to ensure fairness, justice, and protection of women’s rights.

### **6.1 Scope**

✅ **What is polygamy?**

- Under traditional Islamic law, a Muslim man can marry up to **four wives** at the same time.
    
- Based on Quran (Surah An-Nisa 4:3):  
    _“…then marry those that please you of [other] women, two or three or four. But if you fear that you will not be just, then [marry only] one…”_
    

✅ **Purpose**

- Originally permitted to provide protection for widows, orphans, or in social circumstances where it was needed.
    
- Not compulsory — a choice, not a duty.

### **6.2 Limitation**

✅ **Conditions for multiple wives**

- _Justice_ is mandatory — husband must treat all wives equally in:
    
    - **Financial support** (maintenance).
        
    - **Time and attention** (living arrangements).
        
    - **Emotional fairness** (no favoritism).
        

✅ **Moral restriction**

- Quran warns: If you cannot do justice → then marry only one.
    
- Many Islamic scholars say perfect equality is almost impossible — so polygamy should be rare, not normal practice.

### **6.3 Statutory Restrictions**

✅ **Bangladesh Law**

- Under **Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961**:
    
    - A husband must get **prior written permission** from the _Arbitration Council_ before contracting another marriage while having a living wife.
        
    - Must show valid reasons.
        
    - The Council must notify the existing wife/wives.
        
    - Violation = fine or imprisonment.
        

✅ **Effect of breach**

- If a man marries again without permission:
    
    - The marriage itself is _not void_ under Sharia.
        
    - But he commits an offence under statutory law.
        
    - First wife can claim divorce or maintenance based on breach.
        

✅ **Trend**

- Modern courts generally discourage polygamy by enforcing strict procedural compliance.
    
- Women can negotiate conditions against polygamy in the _Nikah Nama_.

## ⚖️ **Modern Perspective**

- Many Muslim-majority countries heavily regulate polygamy or discourage it altogether.
    
- Contemporary Islamic scholars often argue for monogamy as the ethical ideal unless exceptional conditions exist.

## ✅ **Key Takeaway**

Polygamy is allowed but **not free from conditions** — it demands _justice, fairness, legal permission,_ and respect for the rights of existing wives.  
Misuse is checked by both Sharia principles and statutory law.
