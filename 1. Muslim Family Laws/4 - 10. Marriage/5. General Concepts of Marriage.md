## 📚 **5. General Concepts of Marriage**

### 🔑 **Main Idea**

Marriage (_Nikah_) in Islam is not just a moral or spiritual bond — it’s a **civil contract** with specific _requirements_, _conditions_, and _legal effects_.  
To be valid, every marriage must meet certain essential **elements** and **formalities** — otherwise it can be _void_, _irregular_, or _illegal_ under Sharia and statutory law.

### 🧩 **Subtopics**

---

### **5.1 Capacity**

✅ **Who can marry?**

- Must be **Muslim**, **sane**, and **pubescent** (or mature enough to understand marriage).
    
- Guardians (_wali_) may contract marriage on behalf of minors (though modern laws often restrict child marriage).
    
- Parties must be legally capable — no legal impediment (like close blood relationship).
    

---

### **5.2 Formation**

✅ **How does it form?**

- By a clear **offer** (_ijab_) from one party and **acceptance** (_qabul_) by the other — at the same sitting/session.
    
- Consent must be free — forced marriage is invalid in Sharia.
    
- Must be in presence of **witnesses** (at least 2 adult male Muslims, or 1 male + 2 females).

### **5.3 Elements**

✅ **Essential elements**

- **Offer & Acceptance** (Ijab-o-Qabul).
    
- **Capacity** (legal competence of bride & groom).
    
- **Witnesses** (for public acknowledgment).
    
- **Mahr** (Dower) — must be specified or implied.
    

---

### **5.4 Conditions**

✅ **Key conditions**

- _No prohibited relationship_ (blood ties, foster ties within prohibited degrees).
    
- _Observance of Iddat_ — a woman cannot remarry during waiting period after divorce or husband’s death.
    
- _No polygamy violations_ — must follow statutory restrictions if taking more than one wife.
    

---

### **5.5 Witness**

✅ **Why witnesses matter**

- Makes the marriage public — prevents secret marriage.
    
- Protects parties’ rights.
    
- Testimony helps in disputes.
    
- If no witness → marriage may be _void_ or _irregular_ depending on school of law.

### **5.6 Statutory Requirements of Age and Registration**

✅ **Age**

- Islamic law sets puberty as threshold — modern law sets **minimum statutory age**.
    
    - In Bangladesh: minimum age for marriage is 18 for women, 21 for men (Child Marriage Restraint Act 1929, updated 2017).
        
- Underage marriage is _not automatically void_ in Sharia but is an offence under statutory law.
    

✅ **Registration**

- Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961 requires registration of marriage through _Nikah Registrar_.
    
- Unregistered marriage is valid under Sharia but punishable under statutory law.
    

---

### **5.7 Irregular Marriages**

✅ **Fasid Nikah**

- Neither fully valid nor void — _irregular_ due to a correctable defect.
    
- Examples:
    
    - Marriage without witnesses.
        
    - A woman marrying during iddat.
        
    - Marriage with a fifth wife while four are already lawfully married.
        

✅ **Effect**

- Can be regularized by removing the defect.
    
- Children born in irregular marriage are legitimate under Sunni law.
    

---

## ⚖️ **Modern Relevance**

- Bangladeshi courts often check _capacity_, _valid consent_, _registration_, _age_, _witnesses_ when hearing disputes.
    
- Lawyers must ensure all elements are documented to avoid later invalidation.
    

---

## ✅ **Key Takeaway**

The general rules of marriage show that a valid _Nikah_ balances Sharia principles with modern statutory law to protect rights, ensure fairness, and prevent abuse.
