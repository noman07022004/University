## üìö **9. Divorce**

**Overview:**  
In Muslim Family Law, divorce (_talaq_) is the legal dissolution of marriage. It is governed by both _classical Islamic jurisprudence_ and _statutory laws_ in Bangladesh. The Quran, Sunnah, and modern statutes regulate how, when, and by whom divorce can be initiated ‚Äî and what rights and obligations arise after.
