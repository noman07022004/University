Of course. Let's cover the methods of dissolving a marriage by mutual consent.

### 9.7 Dissolution by mutual consent ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: `Khula` and `Mubarat` are the primary methods for an amicable, agreement-based end to a marriage. They represent the contractual aspect of dissolving the marital tie, providing an important alternative to the husband's unilateral `talaq` or the wife's potentially lengthy judicial process of `faskh`. Understanding these consensual forms is key to appreciating the full spectrum of divorce options.

#### Detailed Explanation

In addition to dissolution by the unilateral act of the husband or by a court decree, Islamic law provides for the termination of a marriage by the mutual agreement of both spouses. These forms are contractual in nature and result in an immediate and irrevocable divorce. The two main forms are `Khula` and `Mubarat`.

### **1. `Khula` (Redemption)**

- **Definition**: `Khula` is a form of divorce that is initiated at the instance of the **wife**, where she agrees to give some consideration (`iwad`) to her husband in exchange for his agreement to release her from the marital bond. It is essentially the wife "redeeming" herself from the marriage.
    
- **The Initiative**: The key feature of `Khula` is that the desire and offer to end the marriage come from the **wife's side**.
    
- **The Consideration (`Iwad`)**: The payment or consideration from the wife is an essential element of `Khula`. Most commonly, this involves the wife agreeing to:
    
    - **Forgo her unpaid dower (`mahr`)**.
        
    - Return the dower if it has already been paid. The consideration can also be other property. If the husband is the party at fault for the breakdown of the marriage, it is considered morally reprehensible for him to demand any consideration for granting the `Khula`.
        
- **Legal Effect**: Once the husband accepts the wife's offer, a **single irrevocable divorce (`talaq-i-bain`)** takes place. The dissolution is effective immediately, and the husband cannot unilaterally revoke it.

### **2. `Mubarat` (Mutual Freeing)**

- **Definition**: `Mubarat` is a form of divorce where the desire and aversion to continue the marriage are **mutual**. Both the husband and the wife wish to be freed from the marital contract.
    
- **The Initiative**: Unlike `Khula`, the initiative for `Mubarat` can come from **either side**. The key element is the mutual desire to separate. The term itself means "freeing one another."
    
- **The Consideration**: In a `Mubarat`, it is generally implied that the wife will waive her claim to her dower, as it is a mutual release from all marital obligations.
    
- **Legal Effect**: Like `Khula`, a `Mubarat` also results in a **single irrevocable divorce (`talaq-i-bain`)** that takes effect as soon as the parties mutually agree to it.
    

|**Feature**|**`Khula` (Redemption)**|**`Mubarat` (Mutual Freeing)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Initiative**|From the **wife's** side.|From **either** side (desire is mutual).|
|**Consideration**|**Essential** that the wife gives consideration.|A mutual release of claims is implied.|

**Statutory Context in Bangladesh**: Divorces by `Khula` and `Mubarat` do not require the 90-day notice procedure under Section 7 of the MFLO, 1961, as that procedure is designed for unilateral `talaq`. However, once the mutual divorce is finalized, it **must be registered** under The Muslim Marriages and Divorces (Registration) Act, 1974.
