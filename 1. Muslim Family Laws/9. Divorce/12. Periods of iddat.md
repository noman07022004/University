Of course. Let's cover the specific periods of `iddat`.

### 9.12 Periods of iddat ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: The rules of `iddat` are a mandatory legal and religious requirement for a woman following the dissolution of her marriage. Knowing the correct duration of the `iddat` period is essential, as it has crucial legal consequences, primarily for establishing the paternity of a child and determining when the woman is lawfully permitted to remarry.

#### Detailed Explanation

**`Iddat`** is the compulsory waiting period that a woman must observe after her marriage is terminated by divorce or the death of her husband. During this period, she is prohibited from marrying another man. The duration of the `iddat` varies depending on the manner of the dissolution and the physiological state of the woman.

**The Purposes of `Iddat`**

1. **To Ascertain Pregnancy**: This is the primary legal objective, to prevent any confusion about the paternity of a child conceived during the marriage.
    
2. **To Allow for Reconciliation**: In the case of a revocable divorce, it provides a "cooling-off" period.
    
3. **To Mourn the Deceased**: In the case of a husband's death, it is a prescribed period of mourning.

**Duration of `Iddat` in Different Circumstances**

**1. After a Divorce (`Talaq`)**

- **For a woman subject to menstruation**: The `iddat` period is **three complete menstrual cycles**.
    
- **For a woman who no longer menstruates** (due to age) or has not yet started: The `iddat` period is **three lunar months**.
    
- **For a woman who is pregnant**: The `iddat` period lasts until she **delivers the child**.
    
- **For an unconsummated marriage**: If the marriage was dissolved by divorce **before it was consummated**, the wife is **not required to observe any `iddat`**. She is free to remarry immediately.
    

**2. After the Death of the Husband**

- **The General Rule**: The `iddat` period for a widow is **four months and ten days**. This applies whether the marriage was consummated or not.
    
- **If the widow is pregnant**: If she is pregnant at the time of her husband's death, her `iddat` period extends until she **delivers the child** OR until the completion of **four months and ten days**, **whichever period is longer**.
    
    - **Example A**: If her husband dies and she gives birth 2 months later, her `iddat` is not over. She must continue to wait for another 2 months and 10 days to complete the full mourning period.
        
    - **Example B**: If her husband dies and she gives birth 6 months later, her `iddat` ends at the moment of delivery because that period is longer than 4 months and 10 days.
