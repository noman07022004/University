Of course. Let's cover the rules on remarriage after a divorce.

### 9.10 Remarriage ⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This topic is important because it deals with the legal consequences and finality of a divorce. It outlines the specific rules and potential impediments that govern a divorced person's ability to marry again, either to a new person or to their former spouse. The special rule of `halala` for a thrice-divorced couple is a particularly key concept.

#### Detailed Explanation

After a divorce becomes final and irrevocable, the parties are legally free to marry again. However, this freedom is subject to specific rules, which differ depending on whom the divorced wife intends to marry.

**1. Remarriage to a Different Person**

- **The Rule**: A divorced woman is free to marry any man other than her former husband, but only **after the completion of her `iddat`** (waiting period).
    
- **Purpose of `Iddat`**: The primary purpose of the `iddat` is to ascertain whether she is pregnant from her previous husband, in order to prevent confusion of parentage.
    
- **Legal Effect of Violation**: A marriage contracted by a woman while she is still in her `iddat` period is not void, but it is **irregular (`fasid`)**.
    

**2. Remarriage to the Same Husband (After a First or Second `Talaq`)**

- **The Rule**: If a husband has divorced his wife for the **first time or the second time**, and that divorce has become irrevocable, the couple is permitted to remarry each other.
    
- **Procedure**: They cannot simply resume their life together. To remarry, they must go through a **new, formal marriage contract (`nikah`)**, complete with a new dower (`mahr`) and all other legal requirements.
    
- **No Intervening Marriage**: There is no requirement for the wife to marry another man in this situation.
    

**3. Remarriage to the Same Husband (After the Third `Talaq`)**

This scenario is subject to a significant legal and religious bar.

- **The Rule**: If a husband has divorced his wife for the **third time** (whether through three successive pronouncements in the `Hasan` form or a "triple talaq" in the `Bid'at` form), the divorce becomes a `talaq` of the third degree, making it a "major" irrevocable divorce (`talaq al-mughallazah`). After this, it becomes **unlawful (`haram`)** for the couple to directly remarry each other.
    
- **The Condition of an Intervening Marriage (`Halala`)**: The legal bar to their remarriage can only be lifted through a process known as **`halala`**. This requires the fulfillment of the following strict conditions:
    
    1. The wife must observe the `iddat` from the third divorce.
        
    2. She must then **lawfully and genuinely marry another man**.
        
    3. This second marriage must be **actually consummated**.
        
    4. This second marriage must then be **lawfully dissolved** (either by the death of the second husband or by him divorcing her).
        
    5. She must observe another `iddat` from the dissolution of this second marriage.
        

Only after all these five steps have been completed are the original husband and wife permitted to enter into a new `nikah` with each other.

It is crucial to note that arranging a temporary or sham marriage for the sole purpose of making the wife lawful again for the first husband is a grave sin and is forbidden. The intervening marriage must be a genuine, bona fide union with the intention of being permanent.
