#### Detailed Explanation

The grounds upon which a Muslim wife can seek a judicial divorce (`Faskh`) are codified in **Section 2 of The Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939**. A wife is entitled to a decree for the dissolution of her marriage if she can establish any one of the following grounds:

**(i) Husband's Whereabouts Unknown** That the whereabouts of the husband have not been known for a period of **four years**.

**(ii) Failure to Provide Maintenance** That the husband has neglected or has failed to provide for her maintenance for a period of **two years**. This is one of the most frequently used grounds.

**(iii) Husband's Imprisonment** That the husband has been sentenced to imprisonment for a period of **seven years or upwards**. The wife cannot get a decree on this ground until the sentence has become final (i.e., all appeals have been exhausted).

**(iv) Failure to Perform Marital Obligations** That the husband has failed to perform, without reasonable cause, his marital obligations for a period of **three years**. This can include willful non-consummation of the marriage.

**(v) Husband's Impotence** That the husband was impotent at the time of the marriage and continues to be so. Before passing a decree, the court must, on the husband's application, give him one year to prove that he is no longer impotent.

**(vi) Husband's Insanity or Disease** That the husband has been insane for a period of **two years** or is suffering from leprosy or a virulent venereal disease.

**(vii) Option of Puberty (`Khiyar al-Bulugh`)** That she, having been given in marriage by her father or other guardian before she attained the age of **eighteen years**, repudiated the marriage before attaining the age of **nineteen years**, provided that the marriage has not been consummated.

**(viii) Husband's Cruelty** That the husband treats her with cruelty. This is another of the most important and widely used grounds. The Act provides a non-exhaustive list of what constitutes cruelty, including:

- **(a)** Habitually assaulting her or making her life miserable by cruelty of conduct even if it does not amount to physical ill-treatment. (This includes **mental cruelty**).
    
- **(b)** Associating with women of evil repute or leading an infamous life.
    
- **(c)** Attempting to force her to lead an immoral life.
    
- **(d)** Disposing of her property or preventing her from exercising her legal rights over it.
    
- **(e)** Obstructing her in the observance of her religious profession or practice.
    
- **(f)** If he has more than one wife, failing to treat her equitably in accordance with the injunctions of the Quran.
    

**(ix) Any Other Ground Recognized by Muslim Law** This is a residual clause that allows a wife to seek divorce "on any other ground which is recognized as valid for the dissolution of marriages under Muslim Law." This allows courts to apply principles from classical jurisprudence (like the breakdown of marriage) that are not explicitly listed in the Act.
