Of course. Here is a detailed breakdown of the various types of divorce in Muslim law.

### 9.1 Types ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: Understanding the different types of divorce is the absolute foundation of this entire topic. The legal procedure, the possibility of reconciliation, the finality of the dissolution, and the rights of the parties all depend entirely on the specific mode by which the marriage is terminated. This classification is a critical and core concept of the subject.

#### Detailed Explanation

The dissolution of a Muslim marriage is not a monolithic act. It can be initiated in various ways by the husband, the wife, or both parties, or by a court of law. Each type has a distinct legal name, procedure, and set of consequences.

### **1. Dissolution by the Husband (`Talaq`)**

This is the unilateral repudiation of the marriage by the husband. It is further classified based on its procedure and its revocability.

**A. Classification by Procedure (`Sunnah` vs. `Bid'at`)**

- **`Talaq al-Sunnah` (The Approved Form)**: This form follows the procedure laid down in the traditions of the Prophet and is designed to allow maximum opportunity for reconciliation. It has two modes:
    
    1. **`Ahsan` (The Most Approved)**: This consists of a **single** pronouncement of divorce made during a period of the wife's purity (`tuhr`) in which no intercourse has taken place, followed by a period of abstinence for the entire `iddat` (waiting period). The divorce becomes final and irrevocable only at the end of the `iddat`.
        
    2. **`Hasan` (The Approved)**: This consists of **three** successive pronouncements of divorce, made during three separate, consecutive periods of purity. The divorce becomes final and irrevocable upon the third pronouncement.
        
- **`Talaq al-Bid'at` (The Disapproved/Innovated Form)**: This form deviates from the `Sunnah` and is considered sinful, yet it is recognized as legally effective by the Hanafi school.
    
    - The most common form is the **"Triple `Talaq`"**, where the husband makes three pronouncements in a single sentence or a single sitting (e.g., "I divorce you thrice").
        
    - Its primary legal effect is that the divorce becomes **immediately final and irrevocable**, leaving no room for reconciliation during the `iddat`.
        

**B. Classification by Revocability**

- **Revocable (`Raji`) `Talaq`**: This is a divorce where the husband can revoke the dissolution before the `iddat` period ends, either by express words or by resuming marital relations. The first and second pronouncements in the `Hasan` form and the single pronouncement in the `Ahsan` form are revocable during the `iddat`.
    
- **Irrevocable (`Bain`) `Talaq`**: This is a divorce that becomes final immediately upon pronouncement or upon the expiry of the `iddat`, completely severing the marital tie. The `Talaq al-Bid'at` is immediately irrevocable. The `Ahsan` and `Hasan` forms become irrevocable after the `iddat` or upon the third pronouncement, respectively.

### **2. Dissolution by the Wife**

A wife does not have an inherent unilateral right to divorce, but she can dissolve the marriage in the following way:

- **`Talaq-i-Tafwid` (Delegated Divorce)**: If the husband, at the time of marriage (usually in the `Nikahnama`) or afterwards, has delegated his power of `talaq` to his wife, she can exercise this right and pronounce a divorce on herself. It is as effective as a `talaq` pronounced by the husband.

### **3. Dissolution by Mutual Consent**

- **`Khula` (Redemption)**: This is a divorce initiated by the **wife**, where she offers to give some consideration (typically by forgoing her dower) to the husband in exchange for his agreement to release her from the marriage. Once the husband accepts the offer, it results in an irrevocable divorce.
    
- **`Mubarat` (Mutual Freeing)**: This is a divorce where both parties mutually agree to end the marriage due to incompatibility. The offer can be initiated by either the husband or the wife. It also results in an irrevocable divorce.

### **4. Dissolution by Judicial Process (`Faskh`)**

- **`Faskh` (Judicial Rescission)**: This is the dissolution of the marriage by a decree from a court of law. This is the wife's primary remedy if her husband refuses to grant a divorce and she does not have the right of delegated divorce. The specific grounds for a wife to seek a judicial divorce in Bangladesh are codified in **The Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939**.
