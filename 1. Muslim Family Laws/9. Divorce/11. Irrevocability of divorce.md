Of course. Let's cover the concept of the irrevocability of divorce.

### 9.11 Irrevocability of divorce ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: The distinction between a revocable and an irrevocable divorce is fundamental to understanding the legal consequences of a `Talaq`. It determines whether a marriage can be easily salvaged or if it is definitively terminated. The modern statutory law in Bangladesh has significantly altered the classical rules on this point, making it a key conceptual and practical topic.

#### Detailed Explanation

A pronouncement of `Talaq` by a husband does not always result in an immediate and final termination of the marriage. Classical Islamic law makes a crucial distinction based on whether the divorce can be unilaterally retracted by the husband.

**1. Revocable Divorce (`Talaq-i-Raji`)**

- **Definition**: A revocable divorce is one where the husband has the right to cancel the divorce and resume the marriage during the wife's `iddat` (waiting period) without needing a new marriage contract.
    
- **Classical Application**: The first and second pronouncements of `Talaq` in the approved (`Sunnah`) forms are revocable.
    
- **Method of Revocation (`Ruju`)**: Revocation can be done **expressly** (e.g., by saying, "I take you back") or **implicitly** (e.g., by resuming marital relations).
    
- **Legal Effect**: If the husband revokes the `Talaq`, the marriage is restored as if no divorce had occurred. If he does not revoke it by the end of the `iddat` period, the revocable divorce automatically becomes an irrevocable one.
    

**2. Irrevocable Divorce (`Talaq-i-Bain`)**

- **Definition**: An irrevocable divorce is one that takes effect immediately or becomes final after the `iddat`, completely severing the marital tie. The husband **cannot** unilaterally revoke it. If the couple wishes to get back together, they must enter into a new marriage contract (`Nikah`).
    

Irrevocable divorces are of two types:

- **a) `Talaq-i-Bain Sughra` (Minor Irrevocable Divorce)**: This type of divorce severs the marital tie but **does not prevent the couple from remarrying** each other with a new `Nikah`. This occurs in cases of:
    
    - `Khula` and `Mubarat` (divorce by mutual consent).
        
    - `Faskh` (judicial divorce by a court).
        
    - When a revocable `talaq` is not revoked before the `iddat` period expires.
        
- **b) `Talaq-i-Bain Kubra` (Major Irrevocable Divorce)**: This occurs after the **third** pronouncement of `Talaq`.
    
    - This divorce creates a legal bar to remarriage between the couple. They **cannot remarry** each other unless the wife first undergoes a valid, consummated, and subsequently dissolved marriage with another man (the process of `halala`).
        
    - Classically, the "triple talaq" (`Talaq al-Bid'at`) was considered to have this effect immediately.
        

**The Impact of The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 (MFLO)**

**Section 7** of the MFLO has fundamentally changed the rules of irrevocability in Bangladesh.

- **All `Talaqs` are Initially Revocable**: The Ordinance imposes a mandatory 90-day waiting and reconciliation period for **all** forms of `Talaq`. This means that **every `Talaq` pronounced in Bangladesh is effectively a revocable `Talaq` for 90 days**.
    
- **Abolition of Instant Irrevocability**: The classical legal effect of the "triple `Talaq`" causing an instant, major irrevocable divorce is **abolished** by the MFLO. Even if a husband pronounces `Talaq` three times in one sitting, it is treated as a single, revocable pronouncement that initiates the 90-day period.
    

Under the current law in Bangladesh, a `Talaq` only becomes irrevocable (`bain`) after the 90-day period stipulated in the MFLO expires without the husband having revoked it.
