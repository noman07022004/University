Of course. Let's cover the statutory procedure for divorce in Bangladesh.

### 9.4 Statutory procedure ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This is the law in action. The classical methods of `Talaq` have been fundamentally altered by the mandatory legal procedure established by the **Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 (MFLO)**. This statutory process is the only legally recognized way for a `Talaq` to become effective in Bangladesh today. It is a cornerstone of modern family law and is of the highest practical and examinable importance.

#### Detailed Explanation

The classical, extra-judicial nature of the husband's `Talaq` has been replaced in Bangladesh by a mandatory statutory procedure laid out in **Section 7 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961**. This procedure applies to any `Talaq` pronounced by the husband and, by judicial interpretation, to a `Talaq-i-Tafwid` (delegated divorce) exercised by the wife.

**The Step-by-Step Procedure**

For a `Talaq` to be legally effective, the following steps **must** be followed:

**Step 1: Pronouncement of `Talaq`** The process begins when the husband (or the wife exercising her delegated right) pronounces `Talaq` in any of the classical forms.

**Step 2: Giving of Written Notice** Immediately after the pronouncement, the husband is legally required to:

- Give a **written notice** of the pronouncement to the **Chairman** of the relevant local government body (e.g., Union Parishad, Paurashava, or City Corporation).
    
- Supply a **copy of this notice to the wife**.
    

**Step 3: The 90-Day Reconciliation and `Iddat` Period** The `Talaq` **does not become effective** upon pronouncement or upon giving notice. Instead, a mandatory waiting period of **90 days** begins from the date the Chairman receives the notice.

- **If the wife is pregnant** at the time of the pronouncement, the `Talaq` will not be effective until the expiry of the 90 days or the end of the pregnancy, **whichever is later**.
    
- This period serves as both the wife's `iddat` and a mandatory "cooling-off" period.
    

**Step 4: The Arbitration Council (`Salishi Parishad`)** Within 30 days of receiving the notice, the Chairman must form an **Arbitration Council**, consisting of himself and a representative from each of the spouses.

- The sole legal function of this Council is to take all necessary steps to try and **bring about a reconciliation** between the husband and wife.
    

**Step 5: Effectiveness or Revocation**

- **Revocation**: The husband can revoke the `Talaq`, either expressly or implicitly (by resuming cohabitation), at any time before the 90-day period expires. If he does, the marriage continues to subsist.
    
- **Effectiveness**: If the 90-day period expires and the `Talaq` has not been revoked, the divorce becomes **automatically effective and final**.
    

**Consequences of Non-Compliance**

- **Criminal Penalty**: A husband who fails to give the required notice to the Chairman is guilty of an offense punishable with **simple imprisonment for up to one year, or a fine of up to 10,000 Taka, or both**.
    
- **Legal Status of the `Talaq`**: The Supreme Court of Bangladesh has held that the notice is primarily for the purpose of enabling reconciliation. If a husband pronounces `Talaq` but fails to give notice, the `Talaq` is not invalidated. It will still be deemed to have become effective after the expiry of 90 days from the date of the pronouncement. However, the husband remains liable to be prosecuted for the offense of not giving the notice.
