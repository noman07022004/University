### 9.8 Dissolution by court ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This is a critical topic of the highest importance. Dissolution by court, or judicial divorce, is the **primary legal remedy** for a wife who wishes to end her marriage but whose husband refuses to grant a divorce (`talaq`) and who does not have a delegated right of divorce (`tafwid`). This process, governed by a specific statute in Bangladesh, is a cornerstone of modern family law and a vital protection for women's rights.

#### Detailed Explanation

When a marriage has broken down and the wife is unable to secure a divorce through her husband's consent (either via `Talaq` or `Khula`), the law provides her with the power to go to court and seek a judicial decree for the dissolution of her marriage.

**The Concept of `Faskh` (Judicial Rescission)**

The legal term for a judicial dissolution of marriage is **`Faskh`**.

- **Definition**: `Faskh` literally means "to annul" or "to rescind." In Islamic legal terminology, it refers to the termination of the marriage contract by a competent judge or court of law based on specific, legally recognized grounds.
    
- **Distinction from `Talaq`**: It is crucial to distinguish `Faskh` from `Talaq`.
    
    - `Talaq` is the husband's extra-judicial act of **repudiation** that ends the marriage.
        
    - `Faskh` is the court's judicial act of **rescinding** the marriage contract due to a specific fault or legal ground presented by the wife. The power lies with the court, not the wife herself; she is the plaintiff who initiates the legal action.
        

**The Governing Statute in Bangladesh**

In Bangladesh, the classical law regarding `Faskh` has been codified and greatly expanded by **The Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939**.

- **Significance of the Act**: This was a landmark piece of social reform. Before this Act, under the classical Hanafi school, the grounds upon which a wife could seek a judicial divorce were extremely limited. This Act adopted the more liberal principles of the Maliki school and made them available to all Muslim women in the subcontinent, providing them with clear and specific grounds to obtain a divorce.
    

**The Proper Forum: The Family Court**

A suit for the dissolution of marriage by a wife must be filed in the **Family Court**, established under **The Family Courts Ordinance, 1985**. The wife, as the plaintiff, must file a formal lawsuit and prove to the court that at least one of the grounds specified in the 1939 Act exists.

**Legal Effect of a Judicial Divorce**

If the wife is successful in her suit, the court will issue a **decree of dissolution**. This decree operates as a **single, irrevocable divorce (`talaq-i-bain`)**. The marital relationship is severed from the date the decree is passed. Following the decree, the wife is entitled to her unpaid dower and must observe the `iddat` period.
