## üìå Divorce ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: Divorce (`Talaq`) is arguably the most complex and consequential topic in Muslim family law. It details the various ways a marriage can be dissolved, the rights and obligations of the parties, and the procedures that must be followed. The classical laws have been significantly modified by statutory interventions in Bangladesh, particularly by the **Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961**, and **The Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939**. Mastery of this topic is absolutely essential.

In Islamic law, while marriage is a sacred contract intended to be permanent, the law also recognizes that circumstances may make a harmonious life impossible, and thus provides for the dissolution of the marriage. Although traditionally regarded as "the most detestable of all lawful things in the sight of God," divorce is a legally recognized institution with a detailed framework governing its various forms and consequences.

The methods of dissolution can be broadly categorized into three groups:

1. ***By the Husband's Unilateral Act (`Talaq`)***
    
2. ***By Mutual Consent of the Spouses***
    
3. ***By a Judicial Decree from a Court (`Faskh`)***

### üü¢ Part I: Dissolution by the Husband (`Talaq`)

In classical Islamic law, the husband has the unilateral right to dissolve the marriage by repudiating his wife. This is known as `Talaq`.

#### üí† Types of `Talaq`:
    
- **`Talaq al-Sunnah` *(Approved Form)***: This is the form of `talaq` that follows the procedure prescribed by the Prophet's traditions. It is considered the proper and most commendable way to divorce. It is further divided into:
	
	1. **`Ahsan` *(Most Approved)***: This consists of a single pronouncement of divorce made during a period of the wife's purity (`tuhr`) in which no intercourse has occurred, followed by abstinence from intercourse during her entire `iddat` (waiting period). The divorce becomes final and irrevocable after the `iddat`. This form allows the maximum opportunity for reconciliation.
		
	2. **`Hasan` *(Approved)***: This consists of three successive pronouncements of divorce, made during three consecutive periods of the wife's purity. The divorce becomes final and irrevocable upon the third pronouncement.
		
- **`Talaq al-Bid'at` *(Disapproved Form)***: This is the "innovated" or sinful form of divorce, but it is still recognized as legally effective by the Hanafi school. It includes the "triple `talaq`," where the husband pronounces divorce three times in a single sitting (e.g., "I divorce you, I divorce you, I divorce you"). This act makes the divorce immediately final and irrevocable, leaving no room for reconciliation.
        
#### üí† Revocability: 
`Talaq` can be **revocable (`raji`)** or **irrevocable (`bain`)**. In the `Ahsan` and `Hasan` forms, the first two pronouncements are revocable. The husband can revoke the divorce, either expressly or by resuming marital relations, before the `iddat` period ends. The `Talaq al-Bid'at` is immediately irrevocable.

### üü¢ Part II: Statutory Procedure for Divorce in Bangladesh

The classical law has been fundamentally altered by **Section 7 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 (MFLO)**. This statute applies to **all forms of `talaq`** initiated by the husband.

#### üí† The Mandatory Procedure:
    
##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Pronouncement: 
The husband must pronounce `talaq` in any form.
	
##### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Notice to Chairman: 
As soon as possible after the pronouncement, the husband must give a **written notice** of the `talaq` to the Chairman of the local Arbitration Council.
	
##### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Notice to Wife: 
A copy of this notice must also be sent to the wife.
	
##### 4Ô∏è‚É£ `Iddat` Period and Reconciliation: 
The `talaq` does not become effective immediately. A period of **90 days** (or until the end of pregnancy, if the wife is pregnant) begins from the date the Chairman receives the notice. During this period, the Chairman must constitute an **Arbitration Council** to attempt to bring about a reconciliation between the parties.
	
##### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Effectiveness of Divorce: 
If the reconciliation fails and the husband does not revoke the `talaq` before the 90-day period expires, the divorce becomes **effective and final**.
        
#### üí† Consequences of Non-Compliance: 
Failure to give the required notices is a **punishable offense**. The registration of the divorce is also legally required after it becomes effective.

### üü¢ Part III: Dissolution by the Wife or by Mutual Consent

While the husband's power is primary, the wife also has several avenues to end the marriage.

#### üí† `Talaq-i-Tafwid` (Delegated Divorce): 
This is the wife's most powerful tool. If the husband has delegated his power of `talaq` to her in the marriage contract (`Nikahnama`), she can pronounce a divorce on herself upon the occurrence of specified conditions (e.g., if he takes a second wife). This divorce is subject to the same statutory procedure under Section 7 of the MFLO.
    
#### üí† `Khula` (Divorce by Redemption): 
This is a divorce by **mutual consent**, initiated by the wife. She agrees to give some consideration to the husband (often by forgoing her dower) in exchange for him agreeing to divorce her. If the husband agrees, it becomes an irrevocable divorce.
    
#### üí† `Mubarat` (Mutual Freeing): 
This is also a divorce by mutual consent, where both parties desire to end the marriage. It is a mutual release from the marital tie.

### üü¢ Part IV: Dissolution by the Court (`Faskh`)

If the husband does not consent to a divorce, the wife can file a suit in the Family Court to obtain a judicial decree of dissolution. This is known as `Faskh`.

#### üí† The Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939: 
This crucial statute codifies the grounds upon which a Muslim wife in Bangladesh can obtain a judicial divorce. The major grounds include:
    
- The husband's whereabouts being unknown for four years.
	
- The husband's failure to provide maintenance for two years.
	
- The husband's imprisonment for seven years or more.
	
- The husband's failure to perform his marital obligations for three years.
	
- The husband's impotence.
	
- The husband's insanity, leprosy, or virulent venereal disease.
	
- The wife's exercise of her "Option of Puberty" (`Khiyar al-Bulugh`).
	
- The husband's **cruelty** (which includes physical abuse as well as conduct that makes her life miserable, such as taking another wife in contravention of the MFLO, 1961).
	
- Any other ground recognized as valid for dissolution under Muslim Law.

### üü¢ Part V: Post-Divorce Rights and Effects

#### üí† Remarriage: 
After a divorce becomes irrevocable, the parties can remarry each other. However, if the divorce was a "triple `talaq`" (pronounced three times), they cannot remarry unless the wife first marries another man, that marriage is genuinely consummated, and is then dissolved by death or divorce (this is known as `halala`).
    
#### üí† `Iddat`: 
The divorced wife must observe the `iddat` period before she can remarry.
    
#### üí† Rights of the Divorced Wife:
    
- She is entitled to her full unpaid dower (both prompt and deferred).
	
- She is entitled to maintenance for the duration of the `iddat` period.
