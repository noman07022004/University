Of course. Let's cover the topic of divorce registration.

### 9.5 Registration ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: Registration is a mandatory legal formality for all divorces in Bangladesh. While non-registration does not invalidate the divorce itself, the registration certificate is the primary legal proof of the dissolution. This documentation is of immense practical importance for securing post-divorce rights and establishing legal status, making this a crucial procedural topic.

#### Detailed Explanation

In Bangladesh, the process of dissolving a Muslim marriage is not complete with just a private pronouncement. The law requires the creation of an official record through a formal registration process.

**The Governing Law**

The primary law governing this process is **The Muslim Marriages and Divorces (Registration) Act, 1974**, and the rules made under it.

**The Registration Procedure**

The registration of a divorce is the final step in the process, and it takes place **after** the divorce has become legally effective.

- **For `Talaq` by Husband or `Talaq-i-Tafwid` by Wife**:
    
    - The divorce becomes effective upon the expiry of the 90-day period as stipulated in Section 7 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961.
        
    - After this period, the Chairman of the Arbitration Council is required to inform the relevant **Nikah Registrar** that the reconciliation efforts have failed and the divorce is now effective.
        
    - The Nikah Registrar then officially records the divorce in the prescribed government register and can issue a certificate to the parties.
        
- **For `Khula` or `Mubarat` (Divorce by Mutual Consent)**:
    
    - Since these divorces do not fall under the notice procedure of the MFLO, the parties themselves are responsible for reporting their mutual divorce to the Nikah Registrar to have it registered.
        
- **For Judicial Divorce (`Faskh`)**:
    
    - When a Family Court issues a decree of dissolution, the court's decree is the ultimate legal proof. The parties should take a copy of the decree to the Nikah Registrar to have the divorce formally entered into the local register.
        

**The Legal Effect of Non-Registration**

This is a critical point of law. The **non-registration of a divorce does not make the divorce invalid**.

If a husband has properly followed the procedure under Section 7 of the MFLO (pronouncement, notice to the Chairman, and the expiry of the 90-day reconciliation period), the marriage is legally dissolved. The divorce is effective whether or not it is subsequently registered. Registration is a procedural requirement for record-keeping and proof, not a condition for the validity of the dissolution itself.

**The Practical Importance of the Registration Certificate**

Although non-registration does not invalidate the divorce, the registration certificate is a document of immense practical value. It is the **official and most convenient legal proof** that the marriage has ended. This certificate is essential for:

- **Proof of Status**: Allowing the woman to prove she is legally divorced and free to remarry after her `iddat` is complete.
    
- **Claiming Dower**: It serves as conclusive proof of the date of divorce, which is necessary for the wife to file a suit for her deferred dower.
    
- **Preventing Fraud**: It protects both parties from any fraudulent claims that the marriage is still subsisting.
    
- **Official Formalities**: It is required for official purposes like changing names or marital status on passports, national ID cards, and other documents.
