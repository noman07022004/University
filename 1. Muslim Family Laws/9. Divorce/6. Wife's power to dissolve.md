### 9.6 Wife's power to dissolve ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This is a critical topic that is central to understanding women's rights in Muslim family law. While the husband has a unilateral power of `talaq`, the wife is not without recourse. The law provides her with several distinct and powerful mechanisms—contractual, consensual, and judicial—to initiate and obtain a divorce. Understanding these avenues is fundamental.

#### Detailed Explanation

A Muslim wife does not have an inherent, unilateral right to divorce her husband in the same way a husband can pronounce `Talaq`. However, Islamic law, supplemented by modern statutes in Bangladesh, provides her with three primary and effective pathways to dissolve the marriage.

### **1. The Contractual Power: `Talaq-i-Tafwid` (Delegated Divorce)**

This is the most direct and powerful method available to a wife.

- **Definition**: `Talaq-i-Tafwid` is a form of divorce where the **husband delegates his own power of `Talaq` to his wife**. This delegation is a contractual agreement, typically made at the time of marriage and recorded in the marriage contract (`Nikahnama`). In the standard `Nikahnama` in Bangladesh, **Column 18** is specifically designated for this purpose.
    
- **How it Works**: The delegation can be unconditional, but it is usually conditional upon the occurrence of a specific event. For example, the wife may be delegated the right to divorce herself if her husband:
    
    - Takes a second wife.
        
    - Fails to maintain her for a specified period.
        
    - Treats her with cruelty.
        
    - Is absent for an extended period.
        
- **Legal Effect**: When the wife exercises her delegated power, it is legally treated as if the husband himself has pronounced the `Talaq`. The divorce is valid and effective. It is then subject to the same statutory procedure under **Section 7 of the MFLO, 1961**, requiring the wife to give notice to the Chairman to start the 90-day reconciliation period.

### **2. The Consensual Power: `Khula` (Redemption)**

This is a method of dissolving the marriage through a mutual agreement, initiated by the wife.

- **Definition**: `Khula` is an agreement between the husband and wife, where the wife offers to give some form of consideration (`iwad`) to the husband in exchange for him agreeing to release her from the marital tie.
    
- **The Consideration**: The consideration is most commonly the wife's agreement to **forgo her dower (`mahr`)**, either in whole or in part.
    
- **Procedure**: `Khula` is a contract. The wife makes an offer, and if the husband accepts, the marriage is dissolved.
    
- **Legal Effect**: A divorce by `Khula` results in an **irrevocable (`bain`) divorce**. The marital tie is severed immediately upon the agreement.

### **3. The Judicial Power: `Faskh` (Judicial Dissolution)**

This is the wife's primary remedy when she wants a divorce, but her husband will not consent to a `Talaq` or `Khula`, and she does not have the power of `Talaq-i-Tafwid`.

- **Definition**: `Faskh` is the formal dissolution or rescission of the marriage contract by a **decree of the Family Court**.
    
- **Governing Law**: The grounds upon which a wife can seek a judicial divorce are codified in **The Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939**.
    
- **Major Grounds**: A wife can file a suit for divorce on several grounds, including:
    
    - The husband's whereabouts being unknown for four years.
        
    - The husband's failure to provide maintenance for two years.
        
    - The husband's imprisonment for seven years or more.
        
    - The husband's failure to perform his marital obligations for three years.
        
    - The husband's impotence since the time of marriage.
        
    - The husband's insanity, leprosy, or virulent venereal disease.
        
    - The husband's **cruelty** (which is defined broadly to include not only physical abuse but also mental anguish, such as taking a second wife in contravention of the MFLO, 1961).
        
    - Her exercise of the "Option of Puberty" (`Khiyar al-Bulugh`).
