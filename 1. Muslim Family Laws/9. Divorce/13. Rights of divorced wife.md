>**Why Important**: This topic is of the highest practical importance as it outlines the specific, legally enforceable financial and personal rights that a woman can claim after her marriage is dissolved. These rights‚Äîparticularly to dower and maintenance‚Äîform the basis of the majority of post-divorce litigation in the Family Courts and are essential for her financial security.

Upon the dissolution of a Muslim marriage by divorce, the wife is not left without legal and financial protection. Islamic law, as supplemented by the statutory laws of Bangladesh, grants her several specific and enforceable rights.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ The Right to Dower (`Mahr`)

This is the most significant financial right of a divorced wife.

- **The Rule**: Upon divorce, the **entire unpaid dower becomes immediately due and payable**. This includes:
    
    - Any unpaid portion of the **prompt dower (`mu'ajjal`)**.
        
    - The **entire deferred dower (`mu'wajjal`)**, which by its definition becomes payable upon the dissolution of the marriage.
        
- **Enforcement**: A divorced wife can file a suit in the **Family Court** to recover the full dower amount. The `Nikahnama` serves as the primary evidence of the dower agreement. The suit must be filed within **three years** from the date the divorce becomes effective.
    

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ The Right to Maintenance During `Iddat`

- **The Rule**: The ex-husband is legally obligated to provide his divorced wife with **full maintenance (`nafaqa`)** for the entire duration of her `iddat` (waiting) period.
    
- **Scope**: This maintenance includes her expenses for food, clothing, and lodging. She is entitled to reside in her former marital home during this period.
    
- **Enforcement**: She can claim this maintenance either through the summary procedure of the **Arbitration Council** (under Section 9 of the MFLO, 1961) or by filing a formal suit in the **Family Court**.
    

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ The Right to Custody of Children (`Hizanat`)

The law prioritizes the welfare of the children, and the mother is generally considered the primary caregiver during their early years.

- **The Rule**: A divorced mother is entitled to the custody of her minor children. Under the prevailing Hanafi school of law, this right extends:
    
    - To a **male child until he attains the age of 7 years**.
        
    - To a **female child until she attains puberty**.
        
- **Overriding Principle**: The ultimate consideration for the court is always the **welfare of the minor**. The court can deviate from this general rule if it finds that it is not in the child's best interest for them to remain with the mother (e.g., if she remarries a man who is not a close relative of the child).
    
- **Father's Obligation**: The father remains the natural guardian and is legally responsible for the **financial maintenance of the children**, even while they are in the mother's custody.

**Note on Post-`Iddat` Maintenance** Under classical Muslim law, the husband's obligation to maintain his wife ends with the expiry of the `iddat` period. While some judicial interpretations in Bangladesh have explored the possibility of a divorced wife's right to "provision" from her ex-husband if she is destitute, this is a developing area of law, and the established legal rights are limited to the dower and maintenance during `iddat`.
