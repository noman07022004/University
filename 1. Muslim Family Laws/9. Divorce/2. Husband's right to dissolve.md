Of course. Let's focus on the husband's right to dissolve the marriage.

### 9.2 Husband's right to dissolve ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: The husband's unilateral right of divorce (`Talaq`) is a historically dominant and foundational concept in Muslim divorce law. Understanding the nature of this power, the conditions for its valid exercise, and—most importantly—how it has been significantly regulated by modern statutes in Bangladesh is essential to grasping the current legal landscape of divorce.

#### Detailed Explanation

In classical Islamic law, the husband possesses the unilateral power to dissolve the marriage contract at will. This right is known as **`Talaq`**.

**The Nature of the Husband's Right**

- **Unilateral and Absolute**: The husband's right to pronounce `Talaq` is absolute. In its classical form, he is not required to provide any reason or justification for his decision, nor is he required to obtain the consent of his wife.
    
- **Extra-Judicial**: The dissolution is effected by the husband's pronouncement itself and does not require the intervention or decree of a court.
    
- **Morally Disapproved**: Despite its legal validity, the arbitrary use of `Talaq` is strongly condemned in Islam. A famous Prophetic tradition (Hadith) states that of all the things permitted by law, `Talaq` is the most detestable in the sight of God.
    

**Conditions for a Valid Pronouncement of `Talaq`**

For a husband's pronouncement of divorce to be legally effective, certain conditions must be met:

1. **Capacity of the Husband**:
    
    - **Puberty (`Bulugh`)**: The husband must be an adult, having reached the age of puberty. A `Talaq` pronounced by a minor is void.
        
    - **Sound Mind (`'Aql`)**: He must be of sound mind at the time of the pronouncement. A `Talaq` pronounced by a legally insane person is void.
        
2. **Free Consent (with a Hanafi exception)**:
    
    - The pronouncement must generally be made with free will. However, in a unique and often-criticized position, the **Hanafi school** (which is followed in Bangladesh) holds that a `Talaq` pronounced under **compulsion or coercion (`ikrah`)**, or even in a state of **voluntary intoxication**, is still valid and effective.
        
3. **The Pronouncement Itself**:
    
    - The `Talaq` can be made orally or in writing (in a document called a `Talaqnama`).
        
    - The words used must clearly indicate an intention to end the marriage. They can be explicit (`sarih`), such as "I divorce you," or allusive/ambiguous (`kinaya`), such as "You are free," as long as the intention to divorce is clear.
        
    - The wife's presence is not required at the time of the pronouncement for it to be valid, but she must be informed of it for her rights, such as `iddat` and maintenance, to commence.
        

**The Crucial Statutory Regulation in Bangladesh**

While the classical right to pronounce `talaq` remains with the husband, its exercise and effect have been fundamentally altered in Bangladesh by **Section 7 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 (MFLO)**.

- **Loss of Immediate Effect**: The husband's pronouncement of `Talaq` **no longer dissolves the marriage instantly**.
    
- **Mandatory Procedure**: The pronouncement merely initiates a process. The husband **must** give written notice to the local Arbitration Council and his wife.
    
- **Reconciliation Period**: The `Talaq` does not become effective until the expiry of a **90-day period** from the date the notice is received by the Chairman. During this time, the Arbitration Council must try to effect a reconciliation.
    
- **Power of Revocation**: The husband can revoke the `Talaq` at any time before the 90 days are over.
    

This statutory procedure effectively nullifies the legal effect of an instant, irrevocable "Triple `Talaq`" (`Talaq al-Bid'at`) and transforms every `Talaq` into a revocable one for a 90-day period, imposing a crucial "cooling-off" and reconciliation phase.
