Of course. Let's cover the "time factor" in divorce.

### 9.3 Time factor ⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: In classical Islamic law, the "time factor" is a significant concept that distinguishes the proper, religiously approved (`Sunnah`) method of divorce from the disapproved (`Bid'at`) one. It was designed to prevent hasty divorces. However, its practical legal importance in Bangladesh has been greatly diminished by modern statutes, making it more of a theological and historical concept today than a point of active litigation.

#### Detailed Explanation

The "time factor" in the context of `Talaq` refers to the classical rules about the specific time a husband should pronounce a divorce in relation to his wife's state of purity or menstruation. These rules were established to ensure that the decision to divorce is deliberate, considered, and not made in a moment of anger or temporary estrangement.

**1. The Approved Timing (`Talaq al-Sunnah`)**

The `Sunnah`, or the method of divorce approved by the Prophet's traditions, requires a specific timing for the pronouncement.

- **The Rule**: The husband must pronounce `Talaq` during a **`Tuhr`**.
    
- **Definition of `Tuhr`**: This is a period of the wife's "purity," meaning the time between her menstrual cycles when she is not menstruating.
    
- **Additional Condition**: For the `Talaq` to be in the most approved (`Ahsan`) form, the pronouncement must be made during a `tuhr` in which the couple has **not engaged in sexual intercourse**.
    

**Rationale for this Timing**:

- **Preventing Hasty Decisions**: It is believed that spouses may feel estranged during the wife's menstrual period. Requiring the husband to wait for a period of purity ensures the decision is made with a calm and clear mind.
    
- **Ascertaining Pregnancy**: If the couple has not had intercourse during the `tuhr` of the pronouncement, it provides a strong indication that the wife is not pregnant. This prevents a situation where a husband might regret divorcing his wife upon discovering she is pregnant.
    

**2. The Disapproved Timing (`Talaq al-Bid'at`)**

A `Talaq` is considered `Bid'at` (a sinful innovation) if the timing does not follow the `Sunnah`. This includes:

- Pronouncing `Talaq` while the wife is **menstruating (`haidh`)**.
    
- Pronouncing `Talaq` during a `tuhr` in which intercourse **has already taken place**.
    

Despite being theologically disapproved, under the classical Hanafi school of law, a `Talaq` pronounced during such a time is still considered **legally valid and effective**.

**Impact of Modern Statutory Law in Bangladesh**

The legal significance of this classical time factor has been rendered largely moot by **Section 7 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 (MFLO)**.

The MFLO imposes a **uniform 90-day reconciliation and waiting period** on **all** forms of `Talaq`, irrespective of when they are pronounced. Whether a husband pronounces `Talaq` during his wife's `tuhr` or her menstrual period, the legal effect is now the same: it does not become final until the 90-day period (initiated by the notice to the Chairman) has passed without revocation.

Therefore, while the distinction between `Sunnah` and `Bid'at` timing remains morally and religiously relevant, the MFLO has removed the immediate legal consequences that were once associated with the disapproved (`Bid'at`) forms of `Talaq` (i.e., instant irrevocability).
