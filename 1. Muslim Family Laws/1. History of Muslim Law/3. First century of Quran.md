# üìë **1.3: First Century of Quran** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Rating Explanation**: This subtopic is rated three stars because it provides critical historical context for the early development of Muslim law following the Prophet‚Äôs era, aligning with course learning outcome 1 (knowing sources and applicability of Muslim law). It helps understand the initial application of Quranic principles in family law. However, it‚Äôs less critical than topics like primary sources or statutory provisions, which have direct legal relevance in Bangladesh, and its historical focus makes it less practically oriented for modern legal disputes.

## **üìå Introduction**

The **First Century of Quran** refers to the period immediately following the death of Prophet Muhammad in 632 CE, roughly spanning the 7th century CE (up to around 718 CE). This era, under the leadership of the Rightly Guided Caliphs (632‚Äì661 CE) and early Umayyad rulers, marks the initial application and spread of Quranic legal principles, including those governing family matters like marriage, divorce, and inheritance. Understanding this period is essential for tracing how Muslim law evolved from divine revelation to a practical legal system, influencing modern statutory frameworks in Bangladesh, such as the *Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937*.

## **üîë Key Aspects**

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Leadership of the Rightly Guided Caliphs**

- **Period**: 632‚Äì661 CE, covering the caliphates of Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali.
- **Role in Legal Development**:
  - The caliphs, as successors to Muhammad, implemented Quranic laws based on the Quran and Sunnah.
  - Acted as judges (qadis) to resolve disputes in family matters, such as marriage contracts, dower disputes, and inheritance shares.
  - Example: Umar ibn al-Khattab introduced regulations to ensure fair dower amounts and protect women‚Äôs rights in marriage, aligning with Quran 4:4.
- **Significance in Bangladesh**:
  - The caliphs‚Äô practices set precedents for family law, influencing statutes like the *Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961*, which regulates dower and divorce procedures.
  - Their rulings inform modern family court decisions in Bangladesh.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Application of Quranic Principles**

- **Family Law Focus**:
  - Quranic rules on marriage, divorce, and inheritance were applied directly by the caliphs and early Muslim communities.
  - Example: Quranic verses on inheritance (Quran 4:11-12) were implemented to ensure fixed shares for women, a reform from pre-Islamic customs.
  - Divorce procedures, including iddat (waiting period), were enforced as per Quran 2:228‚Äì231.
- **Community Practices**:
  - Early Muslims in Medina and other regions followed Quranic guidance, with the Prophet‚Äôs companions providing interpretations based on his Sunnah.
  - Example: Marriage contracts required consent and dower, as mandated by Quran 4:4 and exemplified by the Prophet.
- **Significance in Bangladesh**:
  - These early applications form the basis of statutory laws, such as the *Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939*, which incorporates Quranic divorce principles.
  - Family courts in Bangladesh refer to these principles for consistent rulings.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Spread of Islam and Legal Challenges**

- **Geographical Expansion**:
  - Islam spread rapidly beyond Arabia to regions like Syria, Iraq, and Egypt, requiring the application of Quranic laws in diverse cultural contexts.
  - Family law issues, such as polygamy and inheritance, needed adaptation to local customs without contradicting the Quran.
- **Challenges**:
  - Diverse interpretations emerged as new communities adopted Islam, leading to debates on issues like dower amounts or divorce procedures.
  - Example: Differing tribal customs in conquered regions sometimes conflicted with Quranic rules, requiring clarification by scholars.
- **Significance in Bangladesh**:
  - The need to balance Quranic law with local practices during this period parallels modern Bangladesh‚Äôs integration of Islamic law with statutory frameworks.
  - Influences the application of *Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937* in diverse Bangladeshi communities.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Emergence of Early Legal Scholarship**

- **Role of Companions**:
  - The Prophet‚Äôs companions, such as Ali and Ibn Abbas, began interpreting Quranic verses and Sunnah to address new legal questions.
  - Example: Ali‚Äôs rulings on inheritance disputes clarified Quranic shares for complex family structures.
- **Foundation of Fiqh**:
  - The first century laid the groundwork for fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), with scholars using ijma (consensus) and qiyas (analogy) to derive rulings.
  - Example: Consensus on the iddat period for divorced women (Quran 2:228) standardized divorce practices.
- **Significance in Bangladesh**:
  - Early fiqh principles, rooted in this period, underpin the Hanafi school, which is dominant among Sunni Muslims in Bangladesh.
  - These principles guide statutory interpretations in laws like the *Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961*.
