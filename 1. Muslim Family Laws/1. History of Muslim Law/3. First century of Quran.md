### 1.3 First century of Quran ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This period, covering the rule of the first four "Rightly Guided Caliphs" (_Khulafa al-Rashidun_), is critically important as it represents the bridge between divine revelation and human jurisprudence. With the Prophet's death, the community had to learn how to apply the Qur'an and Sunnah to new problems. The methods developed during this time—namely **Ijtihad** (reasoned interpretation) and **Ijma** (consensus)—became foundational secondary sources of Islamic law, setting the precedent for all future legal development.

#### Detailed Explanation

The "first century of the Qur'an" refers to the first century of the Hijri calendar (roughly 622–722 CE), particularly the crucial period following the death of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in 632 CE. During this era, the nascent Muslim community, led by the Prophet's closest Companions, faced the monumental task of governing a rapidly expanding empire without the direct guidance of the Prophet. This challenge forced them to develop a methodology for legal interpretation that would shape Islamic law for centuries to come.

**1. The Primary Challenge: New Problems, No Prophet**

The Islamic empire expanded at an incredible pace, bringing diverse cultures, new social customs, and complex administrative problems that were not explicitly addressed in the Qur'an or Sunnah. Issues ranging from the administration of conquered lands to new forms of commercial contracts required legal solutions. The Caliphs and senior Companions (_Sahaba_) could no longer simply ask the Prophet for a ruling.

**2. The Methodology of the Companions**

To address these new issues, the Companions developed a clear, albeit unwritten, hierarchy of legal sources:

- **First Recourse: The Qur'an**: Their immediate and primary source was always the Qur'an. If a verse provided a clear and direct ruling, the matter was settled.
    
- **Second Recourse: The Sunnah**: If the Qur'an was silent or provided only a general principle, they would turn to the Sunnah of the Prophet. As his closest associates, they had the most intimate knowledge of his sayings, actions, and approvals.
    
- **Third Recourse: Reasoned Judgment (`Ijtihad`)**: This was their most significant jurisprudential contribution. When neither the Qur'an nor the Sunnah offered a specific solution, the Caliphs and leading scholars would use their own independent reasoning to derive a ruling consistent with the spirit and principles of the Shari'ah. This process of exerting intellectual effort to reach a judgment is **Ijtihad**.
    
    - **Example**: Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab faced the question of how to distribute the fertile conquered lands of Iraq. Precedent from the Prophet's time suggested dividing it among the victorious soldiers. However, Umar, through his _Ijtihad_, ruled that the land should be held in trust by the state, with its revenue used for the benefit of the entire community, including future generations. He reasoned that this better served the Qur'anic principle of public welfare (_maslaha_).
        

**3. The Development of Consensus (`Ijma`)**

The Caliphs did not practice _Ijtihad_ in isolation. For major issues, they would convene a council (_shura_) of the most learned Companions in Medina to debate the matter. If this council reached a unanimous agreement, their decision was considered binding on the entire community. This is the practical origin of **Ijma**, or scholarly consensus, which later became institutionalized as the third source of Islamic law.

- **Example**: After the Prophet's death, there was no explicit textual command on who should succeed him. The Companions gathered and, after deliberation, reached a consensus to elect Abu Bakr as the first Caliph. Another key example is the consensus reached during Abu Bakr's time to compile the scattered verses of the Qur'an into a single, authoritative volume (_mushaf_).
    

In conclusion, the first century was a period of dynamic and pragmatic legal development. While firmly rooted in the primary texts, the Companions established the critical precedent that human reason and collective scholarly agreement were valid and necessary tools for the Shari'ah to remain relevant and applicable in changing circumstances. Their legal rulings and methodologies formed the raw material from which the great schools of Islamic law would later be built.
