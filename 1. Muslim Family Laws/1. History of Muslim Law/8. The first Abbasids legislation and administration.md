### 1.8 The first Abbasids legislation and administration ⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This topic is important for understanding the political context in which the classical schools of law became institutionalized. The policies of the early Abbasid Caliphs—particularly their patronage of legal scholarship and their method of judicial appointments—were instrumental in elevating Islamic jurisprudence (_Fiqh_) to an official arm of the state and in facilitating the spread of specific legal schools across the empire.

#### Detailed Explanation

The Abbasid Revolution in 750 CE marked a significant turning point for the Islamic empire. The new dynasty moved the capital to Baghdad and, unlike their Umayyad predecessors, sought to build their legitimacy on a foundation of piety and adherence to Islamic law. This created a symbiotic relationship between the state and the religious scholars (`ulama`).

**1. State Patronage of Jurisprudence**

The early Abbasid Caliphs, such as al-Mansur and Harun al-Rashid, became active patrons of Islamic scholarship. They understood that a stable and legitimate state required a sophisticated legal system.

- **Support for Scholars**: They provided financial support, stipends, and positions of honor to leading jurists. This allowed scholars like Imam Abu Hanifa and Imam Malik to dedicate their lives to teaching and developing their legal doctrines without needing to pursue other professions.
    
- **Intellectual Centers**: Baghdad, the new capital, was established as a major intellectual hub. The Caliphs sponsored translation movements and encouraged debates among scholars, creating a vibrant environment where legal theories could be refined and debated. This period is often referred to as the "Golden Age" of Islamic jurisprudence.
    

**2. The Administration of Justice**

The Abbasids built upon the judicial framework of the Umayyads but made it more organized and central to the state's functioning.

- **The Chief Judge (`Qadi al-Qudat`)**: The Abbasids created the new and powerful position of Chief Judge, based in Baghdad. This official was responsible for overseeing the entire judicial system, appointing and dismissing Qadis throughout the empire.
    
- **Institutionalization of the Hanafi School**: A pivotal moment occurred when Caliph Harun al-Rashid appointed Abu Yusuf (d. 798 CE), the most prominent student of Imam Abu Hanifa, as the first Chief Judge. Abu Yusuf, in turn, appointed judges who followed the methodology of the Hanafi school. This effectively made the **Hanafi school of law the official `madhhab` of the Abbasid state**. This state sponsorship is a primary reason for the Hanafi school's vast geographical spread and its prominence in regions formerly under Abbasid or Ottoman rule, including the Indian subcontinent.
    

**3. The Nature of Abbasid "Legislation"**

It is crucial to understand that the Abbasids did not "legislate" in the modern sense of creating law. The task of interpreting the Shari'ah and formulating the law (_Fiqh_) remained the domain of the independent religious scholars. The state's role was different:

- **Adoption and Enforcement**: The Caliph's administration would _adopt_ the legal opinions of a particular school (predominantly the Hanafi school) and _enforce_ them through its state-appointed Qadis. The state was the enforcer, not the source, of the law.
    
- **Administrative Law (`Mazalim` Courts)**: The Caliphs retained direct control over administrative and public law. They presided over special `mazalim` courts, which handled cases of official misconduct or complaints against the state administration—matters that were outside the jurisdiction of the regular Qadi courts.
    

In conclusion, the first Abbasid period was characterized by state sponsorship, not state legislation. By patronizing scholars and appointing judges from specific schools, the Abbasids helped transform the developing schools of Fiqh into powerful, institutionalized legal systems that would govern the lives of Muslims for centuries.
