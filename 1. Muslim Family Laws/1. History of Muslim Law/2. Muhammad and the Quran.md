## üìå Muhammad and the Quran ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: This is the absolute, non-negotiable foundation of Islamic law. The Qur'an is the primary, divine source of all legislation, and the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is its sole recipient, interpreter, and implementer. Every legal principle, rule, and school of thought ultimately traces its legitimacy back to these twin sources. A thorough understanding of their role is critical for every subsequent topic in this course.


The life and mission of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) (c. 570‚Äì632 CE) represent the genesis of Islamic law. This period marks the paradigm shift from the man-made tribal customs (`'urf`) of the _Jahiliyyah_ to a system based on divine revelation. During his 23-year prophethood, all legislative, judicial, and executive authority was vested in him as the messenger of God.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ The Qur'an: The Ultimate Source of Law

The Qur'an is the central text of Islam, believed by Muslims to be the literal and unadulterated word of God revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) through the Angel Gabriel. As a legal source, it is paramount and holds the highest authority.

##### üí† Nature of Qur'anic Legislation: 
The Qur'an is not a legal code in the modern sense. Rather, it is a book of guidance that contains foundational principles and specific rulings. The legal verses, known as **`ayat al-ahkam`**, number around 500 out of more than 6,000 verses. They cover a wide range of subjects, including:
    
- **Family Law**: Clear injunctions on marriage, dower, divorce, the waiting period (`iddat`), and specific shares of inheritance.
	
- **Criminal Law**: Prescribed punishments (`hudud`) for offenses like theft, adultery, and slander.
	
- **Contracts and Commerce**: Principles of fair dealing, prohibition of interest (`riba`), and rules for contracts and testimony.
	
- **Rituals and Worship**: Rules on prayer, fasting, pilgrimage, and charity.
        
##### üí† Gradual Revelation (`Tanjim`): 
Qur'anic legislation was not revealed all at once. Instead, it was revealed piecemeal over 23 years in response to the specific needs and circumstances of the nascent Muslim community. This gradual approach allowed early Muslims to adapt to the new laws incrementally, such as the phased prohibition of alcohol.
    

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH): The Sole Legislator

During his lifetime, the Prophet was the "living law." His role was not merely to passively transmit the Qur'an; he was its primary interpreter and the ultimate authority on its application. His authority stemmed from his divinely-guided status.

##### üí† Legislator-in-Chief: 
The Prophet's words and actions were the primary means of elaborating upon the general principles laid down in the Qur'an. For example, the Qur'an commands Muslims to pray (`salat`), but the specific method of prayer is derived entirely from the Prophet's teachings and practice.
    
##### üí† Supreme Judge: 
He was the final arbiter of all disputes. His judgments were considered final and binding. He established the precedent for a justice system based on evidence, testimony, and divine principles.
    
##### üí† The Sunnah: 
The Prophet's entire way of life‚Äîhis actions (`fi'l`), his sayings (`qaul`), and his tacit approvals (`taqrir`) of the actions of his companions‚Äîconstitutes the **Sunnah**. The Sunnah is the second primary source of Islamic law, indispensable for understanding and implementing the Qur'an. The relationship is symbiotic: the Sunnah explains the Qur'an, and the Qur'an authenticates the authority of the Sunnah.
    
The legislative process during this foundational period was direct and dynamic. When a legal issue arose, the community would turn to the Prophet. If a specific Qur'anic verse had been revealed on the matter, he would apply it. If not, his own judgment, guided by divine wisdom, would constitute the law. This judgment would then become part of the Sunnah and serve as a precedent for the future.

In conclusion, the era of the Prophet Muhammad and the revelation of the Qur'an is the bedrock of Shari'ah. All subsequent Islamic jurisprudence (_Fiqh_) is an extensive human effort to derive and apply the principles established by these two foundational sources to new times and circumstances.
