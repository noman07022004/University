## **üìå Introduction**

The subtopic **Muhammad and the Quran** focuses on the pivotal role of Prophet Muhammad and the Quran in establishing the legal and moral framework of Islamic law, particularly for family matters like marriage, divorce, and inheritance. As the final prophet of Islam, Muhammad received the Quran as divine revelation, which introduced transformative legal principles that reformed pre-Islamic Arabian practices.
