## **üìå Introduction**

The **Purist Reactions** refer to movements in the 8th and 9th centuries CE that sought to preserve the authenticity of Islamic law by rejecting perceived innovations or deviations and emphasizing strict adherence to the Quran and Sunnah. These reactions, led by scholars like Ahmad ibn Hanbal, arose in response to excessive rationalism or cultural influences in legal rulings, particularly during the Abbasid period. This subtopic is essential for understanding how family law principles were safeguarded, influencing modern statutory frameworks in Bangladesh, such as the *Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937*.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Context of Purist Reactions**

- **Historical Background**:
  - During the early Abbasid period (750 CE onward), some legal rulings incorporated rationalism (ra‚Äôy) or local customs, leading to concerns about deviations from divine sources.
  - Purist scholars reacted against these trends, advocating for a return to the Quran and authentic hadith.
- **Key Concerns**:
  - Excessive use of qiyas (analogy) or istihsan (juristic preference) in family law, e.g., flexible marriage contract stipulations.
  - Example: Some Abbasid qadis allowed local customs to influence dower or divorce rulings, diverging from Quranic mandates (Quran 4:4, 2:228).
- **Significance in Bangladesh**:
  - Purist emphasis on textual sources strengthens the Hanafi school‚Äôs reliance on Quran and Sunnah, shaping Bangladesh‚Äôs family law statutes.
