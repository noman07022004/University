### 1.10 Purist reactions ⭐⭐

**Why Not as Critical**: This topic covers minority movements that opposed the mainstream classical schools of law. While historically and intellectually significant for understanding the full spectrum of Islamic legal thought, these "purist" schools, like the Zahiri, are not among the four established Sunni schools that form the basis of applied Muslim family law in most parts of the world, including Bangladesh. They represent an important critique but are supplementary to the core syllabus.

#### Detailed Explanation

As the major schools of law (_Madhahib_) became institutionalized, a practice known as **`taqlid`**—the adherence of a jurist or layperson to the doctrines of a single school—became the norm. This led to a period of consolidation and refinement within the schools, but some scholars viewed it as a form of intellectual stagnation. In reaction to this, several "purist" movements emerged, advocating for a return to what they considered the pristine, unadulterated sources of the Shari'ah.

The core of these purist reactions was an opposition to the very methodologies that the classical schools had developed.

**The Zahiri School: The Epitome of Literalism**

The most famous and intellectually coherent of these purist movements was the **Zahiri school**, founded by **Dawud al-Zahiri** (d. 883 CE) in Baghdad.

- **Core Principle**: The school's name derives from the Arabic word **`zahir`**, which means "external" or "literal." Its central tenet was that legal rulings must be based _exclusively_ on the literal and apparent meaning of the texts of the Qur'an and the Sunnah.
    
- **Rejection of Juristic Reasoning**: The Zahiris launched a radical critique of the reasoning tools employed by the mainstream schools. They completely rejected:
    
    - **`Qiyas` (Analogical Reasoning)**: They considered it an illicit form of human speculation. They argued that if God had intended for a ruling to apply to a new case, He would have stated it explicitly.
        
    - **`Istihsan` (Juristic Preference)** and **`Maslaha Mursala` (Public Interest)**: They viewed these as entirely subjective tools that allowed human opinion to override divine law.
        
    - **`Taqlid` (Following a School)**: They were staunchly against `taqlid`, arguing that it was a blind imitation that discouraged individuals from engaging directly with the divine texts.
        

For the Zahiris, if the Qur'an and Sunnah were silent on a matter, it was to be considered permissible, and no attempt should be made to derive a ruling for it through analogy. The most prominent later scholar of this school was Ibn Hazm of Cordoba (d. 1064 CE).

**Later Manifestations and Legacy**

While the Zahiri school as an organized `Madhhab` eventually died out, its purist and anti-`taqlid` impulse continued to surface throughout Islamic history.

- Scholars like **Ibn Taymiyyah** (d. 1328 CE), though a Hanbali, heavily criticized the rigid partisanship of the schools and advocated for a fresh `Ijtihad` (independent reasoning) based directly on the primary sources.
    
- In the modern era, movements such as the **Salafi movement** echo this purist call, advocating for a direct return to the Qur'an and Sunnah as understood by the earliest generations of Muslims (_al-salaf al-salih_), often bypassing the interpretive authority of the classical `Madhahib`.
    

In essence, these purist reactions served as a recurring internal critique within the Islamic legal tradition, constantly challenging the authority of established schools and calling jurists back to the foundational texts.
