### üëç 1.9 Schools of classical theory ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: This is one of the most critical topics in the entire course. The classical schools of law, or **`Madhahib`**, are the enduring, systematic frameworks through which Islamic law has been practiced for over a thousand years. All applications of Muslim personal law in the contemporary world, including in the courts of **Bangladesh**, are based on the doctrines of one of these schools. Understanding their founders, core methodologies, and differences is absolutely essential for any student of Islamic law.


By the 10th century CE, the formative period of Islamic jurisprudence concluded, and the legal thought of the early masters consolidated into comprehensive schools of theory and practice known as **`Madhahib`** (singular: `Madhhab`). A `Madhhab` is not merely a set of opinions but a complete legal methodology (`Usul`) combined with a vast body of substantive legal rulings (`Furu'`). For centuries, the practice of Islamic law has been defined by adherence (`taqlid`) to one of these classical schools.

The four major Sunni schools, all of which are considered equally orthodox and valid, are:

---

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ The Hanafi School üåø

- **Founder**: The school is named after **Imam Abu Hanifa** (d. 767 CE) of Kufa, Iraq. His legal doctrines were brilliantly systematized and propagated by his two most famous students, Abu Yusuf (who became the Abbasid Chief Justice) and Muhammad al-Shaybani.
    
- **Methodology**: As the leading representative of the `Ahl al-Ra'y` (People of Reason), the Hanafi school is distinguished by its sophisticated use of juristic reasoning. Its key tools include:
    
    - **`Qiyas` (Analogical Reasoning)**: Extensively used to apply textual rulings to new cases.
        
    - **`Istihsan` (Juristic Preference)**: A principle that allows a jurist to depart from a strict analogy in favor of an alternative ruling that better serves the goals of equity, fairness, or public interest. This methodology makes the Hanafi school particularly noted for its pragmatism and flexibility, especially in matters of commerce and contracts.
        
- **Geographical Spread**: This is the most widely followed `Madhhab` in the world, largely due to its adoption as the official school of the Abbasid, Ottoman, and Mughal Empires. Today, it is dominant in Turkey, the Balkans, Central Asia, and crucially, the **Indian Subcontinent** (Pakistan, India, and **Bangladesh**). _Muslim personal law in Bangladesh is predominantly interpreted according to the Hanafi school._

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ The Maliki School üå¥

- **Founder**: **Imam Malik ibn Anas** (d. 795 CE) of Medina.
    
- **Methodology**: As a leader of the `Ahl al-Hadith` (People of Tradition), Imam Malik's methodology is deeply rooted in the precedents of Medina. Its most distinctive source is the **`Amal Ahl al-Medina`** (the established practice of the people of Medina), which Imam Malik considered a more reliable, "living" form of the Sunnah than isolated Hadith reports. The school is also known for its use of **`Maslaha Mursala`** (considerations of public interest) as a basis for rulings where the primary texts are silent.
    
- **Geographical Spread**: It is the dominant school in North Africa (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya) and West Africa (e.g., Nigeria, Senegal, Mali).

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ The Shafi'i School ‚öñÔ∏è

- **Founder**: **Imam Muhammad ibn Idris al-Shafi'i** (d. 820 CE).
    
- **Methodology**: This school represents the "great synthesis" of the rationalist and traditionist approaches. Its methodology is the strict, hierarchical framework laid out by Imam Al-Shafi'i in his _Al-Risala_:
    
    1. Qur'an
        
    2. Sunnah (based on authenticated Hadith)
        
    3. `Ijma` (Consensus of scholars)
        
    4. `Qiyas` (strictly controlled analogical reasoning) The Shafi'i school is known for its rigorous, systematic, and text-focused approach, rejecting more discretionary tools like `Istihsan` and `Maslaha Mursala`.
        
- **Geographical Spread**: It is prevalent in Egypt, East Africa (e.g., Somalia, Kenya), Yemen, and is the dominant school in Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei).

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ The Hanbali School üìú

- **Founder**: **Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal** (d. 855 CE) of Baghdad.
    
- **Methodology**: This is the most strictly tradition-oriented of the four schools. It is extremely cautious about using human reason in law. The founder's approach was to rely on textual evidence from the Qur'an and Sunnah to the greatest extent possible. The school is known for accepting even weak (`da'if`) Hadith as a basis for a ruling rather than resorting to `Qiyas`. Due to its strict adherence to texts, it is often considered the most conservative of the four schools.
    
- **Geographical Spread**: Historically the smallest of the four schools, it was revived by later movements. Today, it is the official state school of **Saudi Arabia** and Qatar.
    

#### üëâ The Major Shia School: Ja'fari

It is also important to recognize the main Shia school of law, named after the sixth Imam, **Ja'far al-Sadiq** (d. 765 CE). While it shares the Qur'an as its primary source with Sunnis, it has its own collections of traditions (transmitted through the Shia Imams) and a distinct legal methodology that emphasizes the role of reason (`'Aql`) and holds that the "door of `Ijtihad`" remains open for qualified jurists. It is the dominant school in Iran, and is followed by Shia communities in Iraq, Lebanon, and elsewhere.
