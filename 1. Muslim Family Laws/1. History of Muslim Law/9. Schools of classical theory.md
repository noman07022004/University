## **üìå Introduction**

The **Schools of Classical Theory** refer to the four major Sunni schools of Islamic jurisprudence‚ÄîHanafi, Maliki, Shafi‚Äôi, and Hanbali‚Äîthat reached their peak of development and consolidation by the 9th and 10th centuries CE. These schools formalized detailed rules for family matters, such as marriage, divorce, and inheritance, based on the Quran, Sunnah, and systematic methodologies (*usul al-fiqh*). This subtopic is essential for understanding how these schools shaped Muslim family law, particularly the Hanafi school, which underpins statutory frameworks in Bangladesh, such as the *Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937*.
