> **Rating Explanation**: This subtopic is rated three stars because it provides important historical context for the codification and state-driven application of Islamic family law, aligning with course learning outcome 1 (knowing sources and applicability of Muslim law). It illustrates the transition to modern legal systems, influencing Bangladesh‚Äôs statutory framework. However, it‚Äôs less critical than topics like primary sources or divorce, which have direct legal application, and its historical focus makes it less practically oriented for resolving modern disputes.

## **üìå Introduction**

The **Islamic Law under the Ottoman Empire** refers to the application and codification of Muslim law, including family laws on marriage, divorce, and inheritance, during the Ottoman Empire (1299‚Äì1922 CE, with focus on its peak from the 15th to 19th centuries). The Ottomans, primarily following the Hanafi school, formalized Islamic law through state legislation and judicial systems, notably via the *Majalla*. This subtopic is crucial for understanding how Islamic family law was institutionalized, influencing modern statutory frameworks in Bangladesh, such as the *Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937*.

## **üîë Key Aspects**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Ottoman Legal System**

- **Context**:
  - The Ottoman Empire, centered in Istanbul, ruled vast regions, including parts of the Middle East, North Africa, and the Balkans.
  - Adopted the Hanafi school as the official legal framework, aligning with its flexibility for diverse populations.
- **State-Driven Law**:
  - The Ottomans centralized legal administration, with the Sultan and state-appointed qadis (judges) enforcing Islamic law.
  - Family law matters, such as marriage contracts, divorce, and inheritance, were regulated by state courts.
- **Significance in Bangladesh**:
  - The Ottoman model of state-enforced Hanafi law influenced legal traditions in the Indian subcontinent, shaping Bangladesh‚Äôs family law statutes.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Codification: The Majalla**

- **The Majalla (1869‚Äì1876)**:
  - A civil code based on Hanafi fiqh, codifying rules for family law, property, and contracts.
  - Example: Detailed provisions for marriage contracts (e.g., dower, Quran 4:4) and divorce procedures (e.g., iddat, Quran 2:228).
  - Standardized inheritance shares (Quran 4:11-12) for consistent application.
- **Purpose**:
  - Provided a uniform legal framework to govern diverse populations, reducing regional variations.
  - Example: Clarified conditions for valid talaq and khula, ensuring compliance with Sharia.
- **Significance in Bangladesh**:
  - The *Majalla*‚Äôs codification approach prefigures modern statutes like the *Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961*, which standardizes family law procedures.
  - Influences family court rulings by providing a historical precedent for codified Hanafi law.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Role of Qadis and Courts**

- **Judicial Structure**:
  - Qadis, trained in Hanafi fiqh, adjudicated family law disputes in state courts, supervised by the Sheikh al-Islam (chief religious authority).
  - Example: Resolved disputes over dower amounts or inheritance shares, referencing Quranic rules and Hanafi texts.
- **Standardized Procedures**:
  - Marriage contracts required witnesses and dower, as per Quran 4:4 and Hanafi principles.
  - Divorce proceedings followed Quranic guidelines (e.g., talaq and iddat, Quran 2:229‚Äì231), with state oversight.
- **Significance in Bangladesh**:
  - The Ottoman judicial model influenced the development of family courts in Bangladesh, established under the *Family Courts Ordinance, 1985*.
  - Hanafi-based rulings guide modern court decisions on marriage and divorce.

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Integration with Local Practices**

- **Adaptation to Diversity**:
  - The Ottomans governed diverse regions, incorporating local customs (urf) into family law if compliant with Sharia.
  - Example: Local marriage traditions were allowed, provided they included Quranic requirements like consent and dower.
- **Legal Reforms**:
  - Introduced reforms to protect women‚Äôs rights, e.g., stricter conditions for polygamy (Quran 4:3) and women‚Äôs access to divorce (khula).
- **Significance in Bangladesh**:
  - The Ottoman approach to balancing Sharia with local customs mirrors Bangladesh‚Äôs integration of Islamic law with statutory frameworks, e.g., marriage registration under the *Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961*.
  - Influences family court litigation, where local practices are considered within Sharia boundaries.
