### 1.11 Islamic law under the Ottoman Empire ⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: The Ottoman period is significant because it marks the critical historical shift from traditional, jurist-developed law (_Fiqh_) to modern, state-enacted codes. The Ottoman experiment with codification, particularly the **`Majallat al-Ahkam al-Adliyyah`**, was a landmark event that influenced legal reforms across the entire Muslim world and represents the bridge between classical jurisprudence and the modern legal systems of nation-states.

#### Detailed Explanation

The Ottoman Empire (c. 1299–1922), as a vast and long-lasting Islamic caliphate, developed a sophisticated legal administration to govern its diverse populations. This system was characterized by its official adoption of a single school of law and, later, by pioneering efforts in legal codification.

**1. The Hanafi School as State Law**

The Ottomans officially adopted the **Hanafi `madhhab`** as the law of the state. This had several important consequences:

- **Judicial Uniformity**: All state-appointed judges (_qadis_) were required to deliver judgments according to the authoritative opinions within the Hanafi school. This created a standardized and predictable legal system across the empire's core territories.
    
- **Hierarchy of Jurists**: The state created a formal hierarchy of religious-legal scholars, headed by the **`Shaykh al-Islam`** in Istanbul, who was the chief mufti of the empire. This integrated the clerical establishment into the state bureaucracy.
    
- **Entrenchment of the Hanafi School**: The centuries-long state sponsorship by the Ottomans is a primary reason for the enduring dominance of the Hanafi school in Turkey, the Balkans, and much of the Middle East.
    

**2. The Dual System: Shari'ah and `Kanun`**

The Ottoman legal system was not exclusively based on Shari'ah. It operated as a dual system:

- **Shari'ah**: Applied by the _qadi_ courts, this governed the personal status laws for Muslims (marriage, divorce, inheritance) as well as most civil and commercial transactions.
    
- **`Kanun`**: These were secular, administrative decrees issued by the Sultan. `Kanun` law covered areas largely outside the traditional scope of _Fiqh_, such as criminal procedure, land tenure, and taxation. The Sultan issued these laws based on his authority as a sovereign ruler to ensure public order and good governance.
    

**3. The Landmark Codification: The `Majallat al-Ahkam al-Adliyyah`**

The most significant legal development of the late Ottoman period was the creation of the **Majalla**. In the 19th century, as part of the wide-ranging _Tanzimat_ reforms aimed at modernizing the empire, the Ottomans faced a choice: adopt European legal codes entirely or modernize their own Islamic legal heritage. They chose the latter.

- **The First Islamic Civil Code**: Enacted between 1869 and 1876, the Majalla was the first comprehensive codification of Islamic civil law in history. It transformed the principles of Hanafi _Fiqh_ concerning contracts, obligations, and property into 1,851 articles, organized in a modern, systematic format.
    
- **Scope and Purpose**: The Majalla deliberately **excluded family law**. Matters of marriage, divorce, and inheritance were considered the core of the Shari'ah and were left to the uncodified discretion of the _qadi_ courts. The purpose of the Majalla was to provide a clear, uniform, and accessible commercial and contract law for the newly established secular courts (_nizamiye_).
    
- **Historical Significance**: The Majalla was revolutionary. It demonstrated that the vast, discursive body of classical _Fiqh_ could be adapted into the form of a modern legal code. This project served as a model for many other Muslim countries that later sought to codify their own Islamic laws in the 20th century.
    

The Ottoman experience thus represents the critical transition from a legal system based on the authority of classical jurists to one based on the authority of state legislation.
