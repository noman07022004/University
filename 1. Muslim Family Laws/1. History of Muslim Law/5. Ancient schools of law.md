## **üìå Introduction**

The **Ancient Schools of Law** refer to the major schools of Islamic jurisprudence (madhhabs) that emerged in the 8th and 9th centuries CE, formalizing the interpretation and application of Muslim law, including family laws governing marriage, divorce, and inheritance. These schools‚ÄîHanafi, Maliki, Shafi‚Äôi, and Hanbali‚Äîdeveloped distinct methodologies for deriving legal rulings from the Quran and Sunnah. This subtopic is essential for understanding how structured legal frameworks evolved, influencing modern statutory laws in Bangladesh, such as the *Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937*.

  - Named after their founders: Hanafi (Abu Hanifa), Maliki (Malik ibn Anas), Shafi‚Äôi (Imam Shafi‚Äôi), Hanbali (Ahmad ibn Hanbal).
- **Significance in Bangladesh**:
  - The Hanafi school, dominant among Sunni Muslims in Bangladesh, shapes family laws on marriage, divorce, and inheritance, as codified in statutes like the *Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961*.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Major Schools and Their Founders**

- **Hanafi School (Abu Hanifa, d. 767 CE)**:
  - Emphasized rational reasoning (ra‚Äôy) and qiyas (analogy) alongside Quran and Sunnah.
  - Flexible in adapting to local customs, making it widely adopted.
  - Example: Hanafi law allows stipulations in marriage contracts, influencing Bangladesh‚Äôs marriage laws.
- **Maliki School (Malik ibn Anas, d. 795 CE)**:
  - Prioritized Medina‚Äôs practices and hadith, with less emphasis on rationalism.
  - Example: Strict rules on divorce procedures, such as mandatory iddat observance.
- **Shafi‚Äôi School (Imam Shafi‚Äôi, d. 820 CE)**:
  - Systematized fiqh through *usul al-fiqh* (principles of jurisprudence), balancing Quran, Sunnah, ijma, and qiyas.
  - Example: Detailed rules on inheritance shares, aligning with Quran 4:11-12.
- **Hanbali School (Ahmad ibn Hanbal, d. 855 CE)**:
  - Emphasized strict adherence to Quran and authentic hadith, minimizing human reasoning.
  - Example: Conservative approach to polygamy, requiring strict compliance with Quran 4:3.
- **Significance in Bangladesh**:

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Methodologies of Interpretation**

- **Sources Used**:
  - All schools relied on primary sources (Quran, Sunnah) and secondary sources (ijma, qiyas).
  - Differences arose in the weight given to each source:
    - Hanafi: Favored qiyas and istihsan (juristic preference) for flexibility.
    - Maliki: Prioritized Medina‚Äôs practices as reflective of Sunnah.
    - Shafi‚Äôi: Standardized use of all sources, emphasizing ijma.
    - Hanbali: Focused on textual literalism, limiting qiyas.
- **Family Law Applications**:
  - Marriage: Hanafi school allows contractual stipulations (e.g., conditions against polygamy).
  - Divorce: Shafi‚Äôi and Maliki schools emphasize strict iddat rules (Quran 2:228).
  - Inheritance: All schools follow Quranic shares (Quran 4:11-12), with slight variations in application.
- **Significance in Bangladesh**:
  - Hanafi methodology, with its emphasis on reasoning, supports statutory adaptations like marriage registration under the *Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961*.
  - Courts use Hanafi principles to interpret family law disputes.

  - Example: Hanafi law‚Äôs detailed marriage contract rules ensure women‚Äôs rights, influencing Bangladesh‚Äôs legal framework.
- **Regional Variations**:
  - Each school adapted to local contexts, allowing Islam to integrate with diverse cultures.
