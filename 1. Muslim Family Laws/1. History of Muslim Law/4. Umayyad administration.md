### 1.4 Umayyad administration ⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: The Umayyad period marks a crucial transition from the informal, charisma-based legal authority of the early Caliphs to a more structured, state-administered judicial system. This era saw the establishment of the formal office of the **Qadi** (judge) and the beginnings of regional legal traditions. Understanding this period is key to seeing how Islamic law began to adapt to the practical needs of a vast and complex empire.

#### Detailed Explanation

The Umayyad Caliphate (661–750 CE), with its capital in Damascus, presided over a massive empire stretching from Spain to Central Asia. This expansion and the shift from the religiously-centered community of Medina to a sprawling, multicultural empire necessitated significant changes in legal and administrative practices.

**1. Formalization of the Judiciary: The Rise of the Qadi**

The most significant legal development of the Umayyad era was the formalization of the judiciary. While the practice of appointing judges existed earlier, the Umayyads established the office of the **Qadi** as a distinct, state-appointed position across the provinces of the empire.

- **State Appointment**: Qadis were appointed and paid by the state (either by the Caliph or his provincial governor). This made the judiciary an official arm of the state administration.
    
- **Scope of Jurisdiction**: The Qadi's jurisdiction was generally limited to matters of family law (marriage, divorce, inheritance), contracts, and property disputes among the Muslim population. Criminal law and administrative matters were often handled by the governor or other state officials under a system known as _siyasa shar'iyya_ (governance in accordance with Shari'ah principles).
    

**2. The Nature of Legal Rulings**

In the absence of codified law or established schools of jurisprudence (_Fiqh_), the Umayyad Qadis relied on a pragmatic and eclectic mix of sources for their judgments:

- **The Qur'an and Sunnah**: These remained the ultimate sources of authority in theory.
    
- **Local Customs (`'Urf`)**: Qadis often incorporated the prevailing customs of their region into their decisions, provided they did not directly contradict a clear Islamic principle. This was a practical necessity in an empire with diverse pre-existing legal traditions (e.g., Roman law in Syria, Persian law in Iraq).
    
- **Juristic Discretion (`Ra'y`)**: Judges frequently used their own personal judgment and sense of equity to reach a decision, especially in cases where textual sources were silent.
    
- **Administrative Edicts**: They were also bound to apply the administrative regulations and decrees issued by the Caliph and his governors.
    

This approach resulted in a lack of legal uniformity across the empire. The law administered in Kufa could differ significantly from that in Damascus or Medina, reflecting the local customs and the personal legal reasoning of the individual Qadi.

**3. The Emergence of Private Legal Scholarship**

While the state was developing its official judiciary, a parallel and arguably more influential development was taking place. Pious scholars, independent of the Umayyad administration (which they often viewed as too worldly), began forming study circles to dedicate themselves to the study of the Qur'an and the collection and analysis of the Prophet's traditions (Hadith). These circles, particularly in cities like Medina and Kufa, became the intellectual incubators for the systematic study of Islamic law. It was in these circles that the foundations for the great schools of law were laid, setting the stage for the jurisprudential explosion of the subsequent Abbasid era.
