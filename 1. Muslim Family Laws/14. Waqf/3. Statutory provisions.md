Of course. Let's cover the statutory provisions that govern Waqf in Bangladesh.

### 14.3 Statutory provisions ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This is a very important topic because the administration and, in some cases, the very validity of waqfs are governed by specific statutes, not just classical law. The state of Bangladesh actively supervises all waqf properties through a legal framework. Understanding these statutes is essential for knowing how waqfs are managed and protected today.

#### Detailed Explanation

The law of Waqf in Bangladesh is shaped by two key pieces of legislation that validate a specific type of waqf and regulate the administration of all waqfs.

**1. The Mussalman Wakf Validating Act, 1913**

- **Historical Background**: In the late 19th century, the British Privy Council made a ruling that effectively invalidated the widespread practice of creating `Waqf-alal-aulad` (private family waqfs). The court argued that if the primary benefit was for the founder's family and the ultimate gift to charity was too remote, the waqf was not a genuine charitable endowment.
    
- **Purpose of the Act**: This Act was passed by the legislature to **override the Privy Council's decision**. Its sole purpose was to re-establish and confirm the legal validity of creating a waqf for the benefit of one's own family and descendants.
    
- **The Rule**: The Act declares that it is lawful for a Muslim to create a waqf for the maintenance and support of their family, children, and descendants, provided that the **ultimate benefit is reserved for a permanent purpose recognized as religious, pious, or charitable by Muslim law**.

**2. The Waqfs Ordinance, 1962**

This is the primary law in Bangladesh that governs the **administration, management, and supervision** of all waqf properties.

- **The Office of the Waqf Administrator**: The Ordinance creates a central government authority, the **Administrator of Waqfs**. This office is responsible for the general supervision of all public and private waqf estates in the country.
    
- **Compulsory Enrolment**: It is mandatory for the `mutawalli` (the manager of a waqf) to enroll the waqf estate with the Administrator's office.
    
- **Supervisory Powers**: The Administrator has extensive powers to ensure that waqf properties are not mismanaged. These powers include:
    
    - Auditing the accounts of the waqf.
        
    - Inspecting the waqf property.
        
    - Giving directions to the `mutawalli` for proper administration.
        
    - Removing a `mutawalli` for corruption, mismanagement, or breach of trust.
        
- **Restriction on the Transfer of Property**: This is a critical provision. A `mutawalli` **cannot sell, mortgage, or lease waqf property** for a period longer than five years **without the prior written permission (sanction)** of the Waqf Administrator. This statutory control is designed to protect permanently endowed properties from being illegally sold or disposed of.
