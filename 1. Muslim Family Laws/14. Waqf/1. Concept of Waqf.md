### 14.1 Concept ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: The concept of Waqf is the absolute foundation for this entire area of law. It defines a unique form of property ownership and permanent endowment that is central to the Islamic institution of charity and social welfare. Understanding the core concept and its essential elements is a prerequisite for everything that follows.

#### Detailed Explanation

**Definition**

- **Literal Meaning**: The word **Waqf** literally means "detention," "stoppage," or "tying up."
    
- **Legal Definition**: A Waqf is the **permanent dedication** by a Muslim of any property, movable or immovable, for a purpose recognized by Islamic law as **religious, pious, or charitable**.
    

**The Core Principle: The "Tying Up" of Property**

The central idea of a Waqf is the permanent removal of a property from private ownership and dedicating it to the ownership of God for the benefit of humanity. This involves a three-step legal process:

1. **Extinction of the Founder's Ownership**: The moment a valid Waqf is created, the founder's (`waqif`'s) ownership over the property is extinguished forever. They can no longer treat it as their own.
    
2. **Vesting of Ownership in God**: The ownership of the property is transferred to and is considered to be vested in **God Almighty**. The property is now "tied up" permanently.
    
3. **Application of the Usufruct**: While the property itself cannot be sold, gifted, or inherited, its income, profits, and produce (the usufruct) are continuously applied for the fulfillment of the object for which the waqf was created.
    

**The Essentials of a Valid Waqf**

For a dedication to be considered a valid Waqf, four essential conditions must be met:

1. **Permanent Dedication**: The dedication to God must be in perpetuity. A waqf made for a limited period (e.g., for 20 years) or made contingent on a future event is void. The intention to "tie up" the property forever must be clear.
    
2. **The Founder (`Waqif`)**: The person creating the waqf must be an adult Muslim of sound mind and the absolute owner of the property being dedicated.
    
3. **The Subject Matter (`Mawquf`)**: The property being dedicated must be of a permanent and durable nature. Traditionally, this was immovable property like land. However, modern law also recognizes the waqf of movable properties like company shares or government securities, where the capital is preserved and the dividends or profits are used for the charitable object.
    
4. **The Object or Purpose (`Waqf 'ala`)**: The purpose of the waqf must be one that is considered religious, pious, or charitable under Muslim law. This can include objects for the public good (e.g., mosques, schools, hospitals) or for the benefit of the founder's own family and descendants (`Waqf-alal-aulad`), provided there is an ultimate dedication to charity.
