## üìå Waqf ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: Waqf is a unique and highly significant socio-religious institution in Islamic law. It is a form of permanent endowment or trust for charitable purposes, with major implications for property law. The concept, particularly the private `Waqf-alal-aulad` (family waqf), has been the subject of important historical legislation in the subcontinent, and its administration in Bangladesh is now governed by a specific statutory framework.

---

- ***Definition***: A **Waqf** is the permanent dedication by a Muslim of any property, movable or immovable, for a purpose recognized by Islamic law as religious, pious, or charitable.
    
- ***The Core Principle***: The essential characteristic of a waqf is its **perpetuity**. The ownership of the dedicated property is "tied up" or detained, and is considered to be permanently vested in **God Almighty**. Once a waqf is created, the original owner (the **`waqif`**) is divested of their ownership, and the property can never be sold, gifted, or inherited. Only the income or usufruct of the property can be used for the specified purpose.
    

***Essentials of a Valid Waqf***:

1. ***Permanent Dedication***: The dedication must be in perpetuity. A waqf created for a limited time is void.
    
2. ***The Dedicator (`Waqif`)***: The person creating the waqf must be an adult, of sound mind, and the full owner of the property.
    
3. ***The Purpose***: The object or purpose of the waqf must be one that is recognized as religious, pious, or charitable under Muslim law.

### üü¢ Part I: Types of Waqf

Waqfs are generally classified based on their primary beneficiaries.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Public Waqf (`Waqf Khayri`) 
This is a waqf created for the benefit of the public at large. The purpose is purely religious or charitable.

- **Examples**: Dedicating property for the construction and maintenance of a mosque, a public school, a hospital, a well, or a shelter for the poor.
    

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Private Waqf (`Waqf-alal-aulad` or `Waqf Ahli`) 
This is a waqf where the primary beneficiaries are the founder's own family, children, and descendants.

- **The Rule**: In a private waqf, the income from the property is used to support the `waqif`'s family members from generation to generation. However, there must be an **ultimate dedication to a permanent charitable purpose** for when the family line becomes extinct. This ultimate charitable gift is essential for the waqf's validity.
    
- **Purpose**: Historically, this was used as a mechanism to prevent family property from being fragmented through inheritance and to provide long-term security for one's descendants.

### üü¢ Part II: Statutory Provisions in Bangladesh

The law of waqf in Bangladesh is governed by two crucial statutes.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ The Mussalman Wakf Validating Act, 1913

- ***Background***: Before this Act, the British Privy Council had declared `Waqf-alal-aulad` (private family waqfs) to be invalid, arguing that the charitable gift was too remote and illusory.
    
- ***Purpose of the Act***: This Act was passed specifically to **override that judicial decision** and to validate the practice of creating family waqfs.
    
- ***Effect***: It made it legally permissible for a Muslim to create a waqf for the primary benefit of their family and descendants, as long as there was an ultimate dedication to a permanent charitable object.
    

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ The Waqfs Ordinance, 1962 
This is the primary law in Bangladesh for the **administration and supervision** of all waqf properties.

- ***The Waqf Administrator***: The Ordinance creates a government office, the "Administrator of Waqfs," who is responsible for the general supervision of all waqf estates in the country.
    
- ***Compulsory Enrolment***: Every waqf must be enrolled in the office of the Administrator.
    
- ***Supervision of the `Mutawalli`***: The `mutawalli` is the manager of the waqf estate. The Administrator has the power to inspect the waqf's accounts, remove a `mutawalli` for mismanagement or corruption, and give directions for the proper administration of the property.
    
- ***Restriction on Transfer***: A `mutawalli` **cannot** sell, mortgage, or lease waqf property for a term exceeding five years **without the prior written sanction** of the Administrator. This is a crucial provision to prevent the illegal disposal of permanently endowed properties.
