Of course. Here is the explanation of the different types of Waqf.

### 14.2 Types ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: The distinction between public and private waqfs is fundamental to this area of law. The private or family waqf (`Waqf-alal-aulad`) in particular has a very important legal history in the subcontinent and is a key concept to understand, as its validity was specifically confirmed by legislation.

#### Detailed Explanation

A Waqf can be classified into different types based on its primary objective and its beneficiaries. The main categories are public and private waqfs.

**1. Public Waqf (`Waqf Khayri`)**

This is a waqf created for the benefit of the **public at large**. Its purpose is purely religious, pious, or charitable, with no reservation of benefit for the founder's (`waqif`'s) family.

- **Purpose**: To establish and support institutions and services that benefit the entire community.
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - Dedicating property for a **mosque**, a public graveyard, or a religious school (`madrasa`).
        
    - Endowing a **hospital**, an **orphanage**, or a shelter for the poor.
        
    - Creating an endowment for public works, such as digging a well or building a bridge.

**2. Private Waqf (`Waqf Ahli` or `Waqf-alal-aulad`)**

This is a waqf where the primary beneficiaries are the **founder's own family, children, and descendants**. It is often called a family waqf.

- **The Rule**: For a private waqf to be valid, there **must be an ultimate dedication to a permanent charitable purpose**. The income from the property can be used to support the founder's descendants from one generation to the next, but if and when the family line becomes extinct, the benefit must go to a permanent public charity (e.g., the poor).
    
- **Historical Purpose**: This type of waqf was historically used as a form of estate planning to provide for one's descendants and to prevent family property from being fragmented by the laws of inheritance over generations.
    
- **Legal Validity**: The validity of the `Waqf-alal-aulad` was affirmed in British India by **The Mussalman Wakf Validating Act, 1913**, which is still in force in Bangladesh.

**3. Quasi-Public Waqf**

This is a waqf that is a hybrid of the first two types. It is partly for a public purpose and partly for private benefit.

- **How it Works**: The founder may stipulate that a certain portion of the income from the waqf property should be used for a specific public charity (e.g., donating to a hospital), while the remaining income is to be used for the support of their own family.e
