Of course. Here is a detailed explanation of the secondary sources of Islamic law.

### 2.2 Secondary sources ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: While the primary sources provide the divine foundation, the secondary sources are the essential intellectual tools that allow Islamic law to function, grow, and adapt. These rational methodologies, especially **`Ijma`** (Consensus) and **`Qiyas`** (Analogy), are the engines of jurisprudence (`Fiqh`). Understanding them is critical to appreciating how jurists move from a foundational text to a specific ruling on a new issue.

#### Detailed Explanation

Secondary sources, known as **`Al-Adillah Al-Tab'iyyah`** (the dependent proofs) or **`Al-Adillah Al-'Aqliyyah`** (the rational proofs), do not establish law independently. Instead, they are methodologies used by qualified jurists to derive or extend legal rulings from the primary sources (the Qur'an and Sunnah). Their own legitimacy as sources is based on scriptural evidence found within the primary texts. The two most important and universally accepted secondary sources in Sunni jurisprudence are `Ijma` and `Qiyas`.

### **1. `Ijma` (الإجماع) - Consensus**

`Ijma` is the third source of law in the classical hierarchy, following the Qur'an and the Sunnah.

- **Definition**: It is formally defined as the **unanimous agreement of all qualified jurists (`mujtahidun`) of a particular era, after the death of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), on a specific point of Shari'ah.**
    
- **Basis of Authority**: The binding authority of `Ijma` is derived from the belief that the Muslim scholarly community as a whole is divinely protected from error. This is based on several proofs, most famously the Prophetic Hadith, "My Ummah (community) will not agree upon an error." Thus, a ruling established through `Ijma` is considered infallible and binding on all subsequent generations.
    
- **Function**: The primary function of `Ijma` is to provide certainty. It can elevate a ruling that was originally based on a speculative interpretation of a text (`zanni`) to the level of definitive, certain knowledge (`qat'i`). Once a valid `Ijma` is established on an issue, it is no longer open for debate or `Ijtihad`.
    
- **Types of `Ijma`**:
    
    - **Explicit Consensus (`Ijma Sarih`)**: This occurs when every jurist of the age explicitly expresses their agreement on a ruling, either verbally or in writing. This is the strongest form of `Ijma` but is historically very rare and difficult to verify.
        
    - **Tacit/Silent Consensus (`Ijma Sukuti`)**: This occurs when one or more jurists issue a legal opinion, and the other jurists of that era become aware of it but remain silent, neither concurring nor objecting. The Hanafi school considers this a binding `Ijma`, arguing that a qualified jurist is obligated to speak out against an incorrect opinion. Other schools, like the Shafi'i, are more hesitant to grant it the full authority of `Ijma`.
        
- **Examples**:
    
    - The consensus among the Companions to elect Abu Bakr as the first Caliph.
        
    - The consensus to compile the scattered revelations of the Qur'an into a single standardized volume (`mushaf`).
        
    - The consensus that the inheritance share for a grandmother is one-sixth (1/6), a rule not explicitly stated in the Qur'an but derived through interpretation.

### **2. `Qiyas` (القياس) - Analogical Reasoning**

`Qiyas` is the fourth source of law and the primary instrument of legal reasoning used to address new issues not explicitly covered in the texts.

- **Definition**: It is the methodology of extending a legal ruling from a textually established case to a new, unprecedented case, based on the existence of a common **effective cause (`'illah`)** between them.
    
- **Basis of Authority**: Its validity is inferred from Qur'anic verses that encourage believers to use reason and "learn a lesson" from examples, as well as the established practice of the Prophet and his Companions in using analogical reasoning to solve problems.
    
- **The Four Pillars (`Arkan`) of `Qiyas`**: For a valid analogy to be drawn, four essential components must be present:
    
    1. **`Asl` (The Root)**: The original case for which a ruling exists in the Qur'an or Sunnah. (e.g., The consumption of wine).
        
    2. **`Far'` (The Branch)**: The new case that requires a legal ruling. (e.g., The use of heroin).
        
    3. **`Hukm` (The Ruling)**: The rule attached to the original case. (e.g., Prohibition).
        
    4. **`'Illah` (The Effective Cause)**: The underlying attribute or reason for the original ruling, which must also be found in the new case. This is identified through juristic reasoning (`Ijtihad`). (e.g., The property of intoxication which causes harm to the mind and body).
        
- **Example in Practice**:
    
    - **`Asl`**: The Qur'an prohibits the consumption of wine (`khamr`).
        
    - **`Hukm`**: The ruling is prohibition (`haram`).
        
    - **`'Illah`**: A jurist determines that the effective cause for this prohibition is not that wine is made from grapes, but its capacity to intoxicate.
        
    - **`Far'`**: A new substance, like crystal meth, appears.
        
    - **Process**: Since crystal meth shares the same effective cause (`'illah`) of intoxication, the ruling (`hukm`) of prohibition is extended from the original case to this new case.
        
    - **Conclusion**: Crystal meth is declared prohibited by `Qiyas`.
        

In conclusion, `Ijma` and `Qiyas` are the two principal secondary sources that provide Islamic jurisprudence with stability and dynamism. `Ijma` consolidates legal opinions into certain truths, while `Qiyas` ensures that the principles of the Shari'ah can be systematically applied to address the evolving challenges of society.
