Of course. Let's cover the different types of dower.

### 7.3 Types ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This is a critical, exam-heavy topic. The classification of dower into its different types determines **when** and **how** a wife can claim her dower payment. All legal rights and remedies associated with dower, such as the right to refuse consummation or sue for payment, are directly linked to whether the dower is prompt, deferred, specified, or proper.

#### Detailed Explanation

In Muslim law, dower (`Mahr`) is classified into two main categories based on how the amount is determined: **Specified Dower** and **Proper Dower**. Specified Dower is then further subdivided based on when it is payable.

---

### **1. Specified Dower (`Mahr-i-Musamma`)**

This is the most common type of dower. It is the amount that is **fixed and agreed upon by the parties** either before or at the time of the marriage. The specified amount is typically recorded in the official marriage register, the **`Nikahnama`**.

Specified dower is divided into two parts according to the time of payment:

#### **a) Prompt Dower (`Mahr-i-Mu'ajjal`)**

- **Definition**: This is the portion of the specified dower that is payable **on the wife's demand** at any time after the marriage is solemnized. It is due immediately.
    
- **Significance**: It provides the wife with immediate financial autonomy.
    
- **Key Enforcement Right**: Before the marriage is consummated, the wife has the legal right to **refuse to live with her husband and to refuse consummation** until the prompt dower is paid. This is her most powerful tool for ensuring payment. Even during this period of refusal, the husband is legally obligated to provide her with maintenance.
    

#### **b) Deferred Dower (`Mahr-i-Mu'wajjal`)**

- **Definition**: This is the portion of the specified dower that becomes due and payable only upon the **dissolution of the marriage**, either by the **death of the husband** or by **divorce**.
    
- **Significance**: It serves two primary functions:
    
    1. It acts as a form of **financial security** for the wife, ensuring she is not left without means if the marriage ends.
        
    2. It acts as a **check on the husband's power** to issue an arbitrary or impulsive unilateral divorce (`talaq`), as the often-significant sum becomes immediately payable upon doing so.
        

**Presumption when Specification is Absent**: If the `Nikahnama` specifies a total dower amount but fails to delineate how much is prompt and how much is deferred, the courts in Bangladesh, following established judicial precedent, will determine a "reasonable" portion to be prompt based on the customs of the community and the status of the wife. This is often calculated as one-third or one-half of the total amount.

### **2. Proper Dower (`Mahr al-Mithl`)**

This is an **unspecified dower** that is determined and imposed by law. A wife is entitled to Proper Dower in situations where the marriage was validly contracted, but the dower amount was not fixed or the agreement was void.

**When it Applies**:

- When the marriage contract is silent on the amount of dower.
    
- When the parties explicitly agree that the wife will receive no dower (as this stipulation is void).
    
- When the dower specified is illegal under Islamic law (e.g., alcohol) or the agreement is void due to uncertainty.
    

**How it is Determined**:

Proper dower is not determined based on the husband's financial capacity. Instead, it is determined by the court with reference to the **social and financial position of the wife's paternal family**. The court will consider:

- The amount of dower fixed for other female members of her father's family (e.g., her sisters, paternal aunts).
    
- The wife's personal attributes, such as her age, beauty, education, and character.
    
- The social status of her father's family.
