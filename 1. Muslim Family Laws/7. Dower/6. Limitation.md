Of course. Let's cover the final subtopic on dower, which deals with the time limits for legal action.

### 7.6 Limitation ⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This topic is crucial from a procedural and litigation standpoint. A legal right, no matter how strong, can become unenforceable if not claimed within the time limit prescribed by law. Understanding the specific limitation periods for filing a suit for dower is essential for any legal practitioner advising a client on their rights.

#### Detailed Explanation

The right to sue for the recovery of dower is not indefinite. It is governed by the statutory time limits set out in **The Limitation Act, 1908**. If a wife or her heirs fail to file a lawsuit within the prescribed period, her legal remedy is barred, meaning she can no longer enforce her claim in a court of law.

The limitation period for all types of dower suits is **three years**. However, the crucial factor is determining when this three-year period begins to run.

**1. For Prompt Dower (`Mahr-i-Mu'ajjal`)**

- **Governing Law**: Article 103 of The Limitation Act, 1908.
    
- **Limitation Period**: **Three years**.
    
- **When the Period Starts**: The three-year countdown begins from the date when the wife **makes a clear demand** for her prompt dower and the husband **explicitly refuses** to pay it. A simple failure to pay without a formal demand and refusal is not enough to start the limitation period.
    
- **If No Demand is Made**: If the marriage is dissolved by death or divorce before any demand and refusal has occurred, the cause of action arises on the date of dissolution. The three-year period will then start from the date of death or divorce.
    

**2. For Deferred Dower (`Mahr-i-Mu'wajjal`)**

- **Governing Law**: Article 104 of The Limitation Act, 1908.
    
- **Limitation Period**: **Three years**.
    
- **When the Period Starts**: The three-year countdown begins from the date the marriage is **dissolved**, either by the **death** of the husband or by **divorce**. This is because deferred dower only becomes legally due and payable upon the termination of the marriage.
    

**3. For Proper Dower (`Mahr al-Mithl`)**

The same rule as deferred dower applies to proper dower. The right to have the dower amount determined and paid crystallizes upon the end of the marriage.

- **Governing Law**: Article 104 of The Limitation Act, 1908.
    
- **Limitation Period**: **Three years**.
    
- **When the Period Starts**: The three-year countdown begins from the date the marriage is **dissolved by death or divorce**.
    

**Special Consideration: The Widow's Right of Retention**

There is an important exception to these rules. If a widow is in lawful possession of her deceased husband's property under her "right of retention," the statute of limitation **does not run against her**. She is not obligated to file a suit to claim her dower as long as she maintains possession. The other heirs are the ones who must sue her to get possession of the property. In such a suit, she can raise her dower claim as a defense, regardless of whether the three-year period has expired.
