### 7.5 Widow's claim ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This topic is of great legal and practical importance as it deals with the wife's financial security after her husband's death. The widow's claim for dower is a priority debt against her husband's estate, and the unique "right of retention" provides her with a powerful remedy to ensure this claim is satisfied, often intersecting with the laws of inheritance and property.

#### Detailed Explanation

Upon the death of a husband, any unpaid dower becomes a central issue in the administration of his estate. The widow has specific and powerful rights to secure her claim.

**1. Dower as a Priority Debt**

Upon the husband's death, the **entire amount of unpaid dower**, including both the prompt (`mu'ajjal`) and the deferred (`mu'wajjal`) portions, becomes immediately due and payable.

- **Status of the Claim**: The widow's dower claim is treated as a **debt (`dayn`)** against her deceased husband's estate. She ranks as an **unsecured creditor** alongside any other creditors of the deceased.
    
- **Priority over Inheritance**: This debt, along with funeral expenses and any other debts, must be paid **before** the net estate is distributed among the heirs according to the laws of inheritance. A widow's dower claim takes precedence over the claims of the legal heirs, including her own claim to an inheritance share.
    

**2. The Widow's Right of Retention**

This is a special and powerful possessory right granted to a widow to secure her dower debt.

- **Definition**: If a widow is in **lawful and peaceful possession** of her deceased husband's property at the time of his death, she is entitled to **retain possession** of that property against the other heirs until her dower debt is fully satisfied.
    
- **How the Debt is Satisfied**: The dower debt is to be satisfied from the **rents and profits** generated by the property she is holding. She is not entitled to sell the property to pay herself.
    

**Nature and Limits of the Right of Retention**

It is crucial to understand the specific characteristics of this right:

- **It is a Possessory Right, not a Title**: The right of retention **does not make the widow the owner** of the property. Ownership of the property still devolves upon the legal heirs at the moment of the husband's death. Her right is limited to holding possession as a form of security or leverage to compel the heirs to pay her dower debt.
    
- **Requires Lawful and Peaceful Possession**: The widow must have obtained possession of the property lawfully and without force or fraud during her husband's lifetime. She cannot take possession of the property for the first time _after_ his death.
    
- **It is Heritable**: If the widow herself dies while retaining the property before her dower debt is satisfied, her right of retention passes to her own legal heirs. They can continue to hold the property until the original dower debt is paid.
    
- **It is Not Transferable (by itself)**: The widow cannot sell, gift, or mortgage the property she is holding. The right of retention is personal to her and her heirs. However, she can transfer the dower debt itself, and the right of retention will pass to the transferee along with the debt.
    
- **Liability to Account**: The widow is not entitled to use the property for free. She is liable to account to the other heirs for all the rents and profits she receives from the property. This income must be used to systematically pay down the dower debt.
