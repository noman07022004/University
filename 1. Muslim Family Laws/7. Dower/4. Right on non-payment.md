Of course. Let's cover the wife's legal rights when her dower is not paid.

### 7.4 Right on non-payment ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: A right is only as strong as its remedy. This topic details the specific legal remedies and actions a wife can take if her dower is withheld. These enforcement mechanisms, particularly the powerful right to refuse consummation, represent the "teeth" of the wife's financial claim and are essential for understanding how the right to dower is protected in practice.

#### Detailed Explanation

A wife's right to dower (`Mahr`) is a legally enforceable right, not just a moral one. Islamic law provides her with significant remedies if this right is violated by the husband, especially concerning the non-payment of the **prompt dower (`mahr-i-mu'ajjal`)**. The wife's legal position is strongest before the marriage has been consummated.

**1. Rights Before Consummation of the Marriage**

If the prompt dower has not been paid, the wife has two powerful and distinct rights before the marriage is consummated:

- **The Right to Refuse Cohabitation**: A wife has the absolute right to refuse to live with her husband and to deny him sexual intercourse until the prompt portion of her dower is paid.
    
    - **Legal Justification**: This refusal is not considered disobedience (`nushuz`) or a breach of her marital obligations. The law fully justifies her actions.
        
    - **Right to Maintenance**: Crucially, even while she is living separately from her husband and refusing cohabitation on this ground, the husband remains **legally obligated to provide her with full maintenance (`nafaqa`)**.
        
- **The Right to Sue for Recovery**: The dower is a legal debt. The wife can file a suit in the Family Court for the recovery of the unpaid prompt dower at any time after the marriage ceremony.
    

**2. Rights After Consummation of the Marriage**

Once the marriage has been consummated, the wife's legal position regarding the enforcement of the prompt dower changes in one key aspect, but her fundamental right to the money remains absolute.

- **Loss of the Right to Refuse Cohabitation**: After consummation, the wife **loses the right** to refuse to cohabit with her husband. Her voluntary consummation of the marriage is considered an implicit waiver of her right to use cohabitation as leverage for payment. She is expected to fulfill her marital duties.
    
- **Dower Remains an Enforceable Debt**: This is the most important point. The consummation of the marriage **does not extinguish the husband's debt**. The unpaid dower, whether prompt or deferred, remains a legally enforceable debt that the husband owes to his wife.
    
    - The prompt dower is still payable on her demand.
        
    - The deferred dower is still payable upon the dissolution of the marriage by death or divorce.
        
- **The Right to File a Lawsuit**: The wife retains the right to file a suit in the Family Court at any time to recover the unpaid prompt dower. She can sue for the deferred dower after the marriage has been legally dissolved.
