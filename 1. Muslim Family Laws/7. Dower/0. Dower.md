## üìå Dower ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: Dower, or **`Mahr`**, is a fundamental financial right of the wife that is an essential legal effect of every Muslim marriage. It is not optional. Disputes over the non-payment of dower are one of the most common subjects of litigation in the Family Courts of Bangladesh. Understanding its concept, types, and the powerful legal remedies for its enforcement is absolutely critical for any student of Muslim family law.

---

Dower is a sum of money or other property that the husband is obligated to pay to the wife as a legal consequence of the marriage (`Nikah`). It is a mandatory and absolute right of the wife.

***üîπ It is NOT a Bride Price:*** `Mahr` is not a payment made to the wife's father or family in exchange for the bride. It is the exclusive property of the wife.

***üîπ It is NOT a mere Gift:*** While the Qur'an refers to it as `nihla` (a gift), in legal terms, it is a binding **obligation (`fard`)** on the husband.

***üîπ It is a Token of Respect:*** Legally and socially, it is considered a mark of respect for the wife and an acknowledgment of the commitment the husband is undertaking.

***üîπ It is Essential:*** The right to dower is so fundamental that a marriage is valid even if no dower is mentioned. In such a case, the law imposes a "proper dower." A stipulation in the marriage contract that the wife abandons her right to dower is void and unenforceable.

### üü¢ Part I: Amount and Types of Dower

#### üí† Amount of Dower

The law provides significant flexibility in fixing the amount of dower.

- ***No Maximum Limit***: There is no upper limit on the amount of dower. It can be any amount, however large, provided the husband agrees to it.
    
- ***Minimum Dower***: The Hanafi school, relevant in Bangladesh, prescribes a minimum amount of **10 dirhams**. In modern practice, this is a token amount, and the dower is usually a significant sum agreed upon by the parties, reflecting their social and financial standing. Any amount agreed upon that is below this classical minimum would be legally raised to meet it.
    

#### üí† Types of Dower

Dower is primarily classified into two main types:

##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Specified Dower (`Mahr-i-Musamma`) 
This is the most common form, where the amount of dower is **fixed and agreed upon** by the parties either before or at the time of the marriage contract. This amount is usually written in the `Nikahnama`. Specified dower is further divided into two parts:

###### a) Prompt Dower (`Mahr-i-Mu'ajjal`): 
This is the portion of the dower that is payable **on demand** by the wife at any time after the marriage is solemnized. The wife can demand it immediately.
    
###### b) Deferred Dower (`Mahr-i-Mu'wajjal`): 
This is the portion of the dower that becomes payable only upon the **dissolution of the marriage**, either by the husband's **death** or by **divorce**. It acts as a form of financial security for the wife in the event of such an occurrence.
    
---
If the `Nikahnama` does not specify which portion is prompt and which is deferred, the courts in Bangladesh, following judicial precedent, generally hold that a reasonable portion (often one-third or one-half) is to be considered prompt.

##### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Proper Dower (`Mahr al-Mithl`) 
This is an **unspecified dower** that is determined by law. A wife is entitled to proper dower in two situations:

- When the marriage contract is silent on the amount of dower.
    
- When the dower was specified but is illegal (e.g., agreeing to provide alcohol) or the agreement is void for uncertainty.
    

The amount of proper dower is fixed by the court based on the **social status of the wife's paternal family**. The court will consider the amount of dower that was fixed for other female members of her family, such as her sisters or paternal aunts, as well as her own personal qualities (e.g., age, education, beauty).

### üü¢ Part II: Enforcement and Remedies

The law provides robust mechanisms for the wife to enforce her right to dower.

##### üí† Rights on Non-Payment of Prompt Dower

- **Before Consummation**: The wife has the powerful right to **refuse to consummate the marriage** and to refuse to live with her husband until the prompt dower is paid. During this period of refusal, the husband is still obligated to maintain her.
    
- **After Consummation**: The right to refuse cohabitation is lost once the marriage is consummated. However, the dower debt does not disappear. It remains a debt that the husband owes her, and she can file a suit in the Family Court to recover it at any time.
    

##### üí† Widow's Claim and the Right of Retention

Upon the husband's death, the wife's entire unpaid dower, both prompt and deferred, becomes a **debt against his estate**. This debt has **priority** over the claims of his heirs. She is treated as an unsecured creditor of the estate.

- **The Right of Retention**: A widow has a unique and powerful right. If she is in **lawful and peaceful possession** of her deceased husband's property, she has the right to **retain that possession** against the other heirs until her dower debt is paid off from the rents and profits of that property.
    
    - This right is a defensive, possessory lien; it does not give her ownership of the property. It is a mechanism to pressure the heirs to satisfy her claim.
        
    - This right is heritable (if she dies, her heirs can continue the retention) but it is not transferable by sale.
        

##### üí† Limitation Period for Filing Suit

The right to sue for dower is subject to a time limit under **The Limitation Act, 1908**.

- **For Prompt Dower**: The limitation period is **three years**, running from the date the dower is **demanded and refused**.
    
- **For Deferred Dower**: The limitation period is **three years**, running from the date of the **dissolution of marriage by death or divorce**.
    
- **For Proper Dower**: The limitation period is **three years**, also running from the date of dissolution by death or divorce.
