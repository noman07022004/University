Of course. Let's move on to the next subtopic concerning the amount of dower.

### 7.2 Amount of dower ⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This topic covers the specific legal rules governing the quantum of `Mahr`. While the legal principles are relatively straightforward, they are of immense practical importance as the dower amount is a key term of every marriage contract (`Nikahnama`). Understanding the minimum legal requirement and the enforceability of the agreed-upon amount is crucial.

#### Detailed Explanation

Islamic law provides a framework that ensures both a minimum safeguard for the wife and considerable flexibility for the parties in determining the amount of dower (`Mahr`). The rules primarily address the minimum and maximum possible amounts. The Hanafi school's position is the most relevant for Bangladesh.

**1. Minimum Amount of Dower**

The Hanafi school, unlike some other schools of law, sets a specific minimum value for dower.

- **The Rule**: The minimum (`aqall al-mahr`) dower in Hanafi law is **10 dirhams**. A `dirham` was a historical silver coin.
    
- **Legal Effect**: If the parties to a marriage specify a dower amount that is less than the value of 10 dirhams, the agreement for the lower amount is not void. Instead, the law automatically elevates the wife's entitlement to the prescribed minimum. She is legally entitled to receive the full value of 10 dirhams. The purpose of this rule is to ensure that the dower is not a trivial or valueless sum, thereby upholding the dignity of the wife and the seriousness of the contract.
    
- **Comparison with Other Schools**: For context, the Maliki school sets a minimum of 3 dirhams. The Shafi'i and Hanbali schools do not set any fixed minimum, holding that anything that has value and can be the subject of a contract can be given as dower, even if it is a very small amount.
    

**2. Maximum Amount of Dower**

This is a clear and simple rule based on the principle of freedom of contract.

- **The Rule**: There is **no maximum limit** (`akthar al-mahr`) for the amount of dower in Islamic law.
    
- **Freedom of Agreement**: The parties are free to mutually agree on any amount of dower, no matter how large. The Qur'an itself mentions the possibility of giving a `qintar` (a large treasure or talent of gold) as dower, indicating that large sums are permissible.
    
- **Enforceability**: A husband is legally bound to pay the amount of dower that he agreed upon in the marriage contract, regardless of how excessive it may seem in relation to his financial means. Courts in Bangladesh and the wider subcontinent have consistently held that a husband cannot later seek a reduction of the dower amount on the grounds that he cannot afford it or that it is excessive. It is treated as a binding debt, and the wife has the right to sue for the full specified amount. This position reinforces the sanctity of the contract and the promises made therein.
    

**What Can Constitute Dower?**

Dower does not have to be cash. It can be any property that has recognized value (`mal mutaqawwam`) under Islamic law. This can include:

- Real estate (land, a house).
    
- Gold, silver, or other precious items.
    
- Shares in a company or other financial instruments.
    
- Any other movable or immovable property.
    

In summary, the amount of dower is determined by agreement, with the Hanafi school setting a floor (10 dirhams) but the law setting no ceiling.
