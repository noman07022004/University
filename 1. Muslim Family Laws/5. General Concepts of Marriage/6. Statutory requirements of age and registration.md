Of course. This subtopic moves our focus from classical jurisprudence to the modern legal framework in Bangladesh.

### 5.6 Statutory requirements of age and registration ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This is a critically important, practical, and heavily examined topic. While classical Islamic law provides the foundation for marriage, these statutory laws represent the modern state's regulation of the institution. They have direct and severe legal consequences, including criminal penalties, and are essential for the protection of rights and social welfare in Bangladesh. Understanding these statutes is non-negotiable for any law student in the country.

#### Detailed Explanation

In Bangladesh, the classical principles of Muslim marriage are supplemented and regulated by several key statutes. These laws do not replace the religious requirements of `Nikah` but add a layer of state-enforced rules to govern its practice. The two most significant areas of regulation are the minimum age of marriage and the compulsory registration of the marriage.

### **1. Statutory Requirement of Age**

This is primarily governed by **The Child Marriage Restraint Act, 2017**.

- **The Legal Rule**: This Act defines a "child" or "minor" as any person who has not completed the legally prescribed age of marriage. The Act sets the minimum age for marriage as:
    
    - **21 years for a male.**
        
    - **18 years for a female.**
        
- **Legal Effect of Violation**: The Act's approach is to **punish the act of child marriage** rather than to invalidate the marriage itself. The consequences of violating the age requirement are twofold:
    
    1. **It is a Punishable Offense**: Contracting a marriage where either party is below the statutory age is a criminal offense. The Act prescribes specific punishments (imprisonment and/or fines) for various parties involved, including the adult groom, the parents or guardians who arranged the marriage, and the Nikah Registrar or any person who solemnized the marriage.
        
    2. **Effect on Marriage Validity**: This is a crucial legal point. The Child Marriage Restraint Act, 2017, **does not automatically render a child marriage void (`batil`)**. If the marriage was solemnized with all the necessary religious rites (offer, acceptance, witnesses, etc.), it is considered legally to have taken place. Its status is that of a **voidable contract**, meaning it remains in force until it is actively cancelled. The primary remedy for the minor party is the **Option of Puberty (`Khiyar al-Bulugh`)**, which allows them to repudiate the marriage upon reaching puberty under the conditions specified in the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939.

### **2. Statutory Requirement of Registration**

This is governed by **The Muslim Marriages and Divorces (Registration) Act, 1974**.

- **The Legal Rule**: Section 3 of this Act makes the **registration of every Muslim marriage solemnized in Bangladesh compulsory**. The responsibility for ensuring registration lies with the groom. The marriage must be registered with a government-licensed Nikah Registrar.
    
- **Legal Effect of Violation**: Similar to the age requirement, the legal consequences must be understood in two parts:
    
    1. **It is a Punishable Offense**: Failure to register a marriage without a lawful excuse is an offense punishable by law, typically with simple imprisonment or a fine.
        
    2. **Effect on Marriage Validity**: This is the most critical point. **Non-registration does not invalidate the marriage**. A `Nikah` that fulfills all the requirements of Islamic law is a perfectly valid marriage, even if it is never registered. Registration is a procedural requirement, not a condition for the validity (`sihha`) of the marriage itself.
        
- **The Vital Importance of Registration**: Although it doesn't affect validity, registration is of paramount practical importance. The registration certificate, known as the **`Nikahnama`**, is the official, primary, and most easily admissible **proof of marriage**. Without a `Nikahnama`, a woman may face immense difficulty in a court of law when trying to:
    
    - Claim her dower (`mahr`).
        
    - Sue for maintenance (`nafaqa`).
        
    - Establish the paternity of her children.
        
    - Prove her status as a wife for the purpose of inheritance.
        

In summary, the state mandates a minimum age and compulsory registration to prevent exploitation and to protect legal rights. Violating these statutes leads to penalties, but crucially, neither violation automatically nullifies an otherwise religiously valid marriage.
