Of course. Let's proceed to the next subtopic, which details the conditions for a valid marriage.

### 5.4 Conditions ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: While the "elements" are the building blocks of the marriage contract, the "conditions" (`Shurut`) are the external legal requirements that must be met for that contract to be valid (`sahih`). The rules on prohibited degrees of marriage are particularly critical. A marriage that violates these fundamental conditions is either **void (`batil`)** or **irregular (`fasid`)**, leading to severe legal consequences regarding the status of the parties and their children. This is a core, examinable topic.

#### Detailed Explanation

For a Muslim marriage contract, properly formed with all its elements, to be legally valid and effective, it must satisfy a number of external conditions (`Shurut al-Sihha` - conditions of validity). The most important of these conditions is the **absence of any legal impediments or prohibitions (`tahrim`)** that would prevent the parties from marrying each other.

These prohibitions are divided into two main categories: absolute prohibitions, which render a marriage permanently void, and relative prohibitions, which render a marriage temporarily irregular.

#### **A. Absolute and Perpetual Prohibitions**

A marriage contracted in violation of an absolute prohibition is **void (`batil`)** from its inception. It is a legal nullity and creates no marital rights or obligations. These prohibitions are permanent and can never be overcome. They are based on three grounds:

**1. Consanguinity (`Nasab`) - Prohibitions by Blood Relation** Based on the Qur'an (4:23), a person is perpetually prohibited from marrying their close blood relatives, including:

- **Ascendants**: Mother, grandmother, etc.
    
- **Descendants**: Daughter, granddaughter, etc.
    
- **Siblings**: Full sister, half-sister, etc.
    
- **Immediate Collaterals**: Paternal and maternal aunts.
    

**2. Affinity (`Musahara`) - Prohibitions by Marriage** A marital relationship creates a new set of permanent prohibitions. A man cannot marry:

- His wife's mother or grandmother (his mother-in-law).
    
- His wife's daughter or granddaughter (his step-daughter), provided his marriage to her mother was consummated.
    
- The wife of his son or grandson (his daughter-in-law).
    
- His own father's wife (his step-mother).
    

**3. Fosterage (`Rada`) - Prohibitions by Milk-Relationship** If an infant is breastfed by a woman other than its biological mother, a "milk-relationship" is established that is treated with the same legal force as a blood relationship. The general principle, based on a Hadith, is: **"Whatever is prohibited by reason of consanguinity is also prohibited by reason of fosterage."** This means a man cannot marry his foster-mother, foster-sister, etc.

#### **B. Relative and Temporary Prohibitions**

These are prohibitions that are not permanent. A marriage contracted in violation of a relative prohibition is not void, but **irregular (`fasid`)**. The irregularity can be removed in some cases, after which the parties may be able to marry validly.

**1. Unlawful Conjunction (`Jam'`)** A man is prohibited from being married simultaneously to two women who are so related to each other that, if one of them had been a male, they could not have lawfully married. The classic example is being **married to two sisters at the same time**. The prohibition is temporary; a man can marry his wife's sister after his wife's death or after divorcing her and the completion of her `iddat`.

**2. Marrying a Fifth Wife** A Muslim man can have a maximum of four wives at any given time. A marriage to a fifth wife while four other marriages are subsisting is irregular. The irregularity is lifted if he divorces one of the first four wives.

**3. Marrying a Woman Undergoing `Iddat`** `Iddat` is the waiting period a woman must observe after the dissolution of her marriage by death or divorce. Marrying a woman during this period is prohibited and renders the marriage irregular.

**4. Difference of Religion**

- A Muslim man can marry a Muslim woman or a `Kitabiyyah` (a follower of a revealed scripture, i.e., a Christian or a Jew). He is prohibited from marrying a woman who is an idolatress or a fire-worshipper.
    
- A Muslim woman is **prohibited from marrying anyone other than a Muslim man**. A marriage in violation of these rules is considered irregular.
