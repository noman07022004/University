## üìå General Concepts of Marriage ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

>**Why Important**: This topic is the core of the substantive law of marriage. It details the essential "nuts and bolts" of a valid `Nikah`, from the legal competence of the parties to the modern statutory requirements in Bangladesh. These concepts form the basis for nearly all marriage-related legal disputes, including those over validity, dower, maintenance, and inheritance. Mastery of this area is absolutely critical for any student of Muslim family law.

For a Muslim marriage (`Nikah`) to be recognized as valid (`sahih`) under Islamic law, it must fulfill a series of essential requirements. These requirements pertain to the capacity of the individuals entering the marriage, the procedural formation of the contract, and the absence of any legal impediments or prohibitions. Furthermore, in modern nation-states like Bangladesh, these classical requirements are supplemented by statutory laws governing age and registration. When these conditions are not fully met, the marriage may be classified as either void (`batil`) or irregular (`fasid`), each with distinct legal consequences.

### üü¢ Part I: Capacity to Marry (`Ahliyyah`)

Capacity refers to the legal competence of the parties to enter into the marriage contract. For a person to contract their own marriage, they must possess two key attributes:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Soundness of Mind: 
The parties must be sane (`'aqil`). A marriage contracted by a person who is legally insane (`majnun`) is considered **void (`batil`)**.
    
#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Attainment of Puberty (`Bulugh`): 
In classical Islamic law, puberty is the threshold for legal majority for the purposes of marriage. A person who is sane and has reached puberty can enter into a marriage contract of their own free will, and it will be legally valid without the need for a guardian's consent.
 
**Marriage of Minors and the Option of Puberty (`Khiyar al-Bulugh`)**: A marriage of a minor (one who has not reached puberty) contracted by a guardian (`wali`) is permissible and valid. However, to protect the minor's interest, the law grants them the **"Option of Puberty."** This means that upon reaching the age of puberty, the minor has the right to either ratify the marriage or repudiate (cancel) it. In the context of Bangladesh, this right is codified for the wife under **The Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939**, which allows her to obtain a decree dissolving her marriage if she was given in marriage by her guardian before the age of 18, provided that the marriage was not consummated and she repudiated it before turning 19.

### üü¢ Part II: Formation, Elements, and Conditions

This covers the procedural heart of the marriage ceremony.

#### üí† The Core Element: Offer and Acceptance (`Ijab wa Qabul`): 
A marriage is formally constituted by a clear **offer (`Ijab`)** from one party and a corresponding **acceptance (`Qabul`)** from the other. This must take place in a single session (`majlis`) to ensure clear and present intent.
    
#### üí† Witnesses (`Shuhud`): 
Under Sunni (and specifically Hanafi) law, the presence of witnesses is a **mandatory condition** for the validity of the marriage. The offer and acceptance must be made in the presence of at least **two adult, sane Muslim males, or one male and two females**. A marriage contracted without the required witnesses is not void, but **irregular (`fasid`)**.
    
#### üí† Absence of Prohibitions (`Tahrim`): 
The parties must not be related to each other within the prohibited degrees. A marriage in violation of these prohibitions is defective. The prohibitions are of two kinds:
    
##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Absolute Prohibitions: 
These render a marriage **void (`batil`)**. They arise from:
	
- **Consanguinity (`Nasab`)**: Blood relationships (e.g., marrying one's mother, daughter, sister, aunt).
	
- **Affinity (`Musahara`)**: Marital relationships (e.g., marrying one's mother-in-law, step-daughter, son's wife).
	
- **Fosterage (`Rada`)**: Milk relationships. If a man and woman were breastfed by the same woman, they are considered siblings and cannot marry.
		
##### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Relative Prohibitions: 
These are temporary impediments. A marriage in violation of these is **irregular (`fasid`)**, not void. Examples include:
	
- **Unlawful Conjunction**: Marrying two women who are so related to each other that they could not have lawfully married each other if one were a man (e.g., marrying two sisters simultaneously).
	
- **Marrying a Fifth Wife**: A Muslim man can have up to four wives at a time. A marriage to a fifth wife is irregular.
	
- **Marrying a Woman Undergoing `Iddat`**: Marrying a woman who is in her post-divorce or post-widowhood waiting period.

### üü¢ Part III: Statutory Requirements in Bangladesh

The classical laws are overlaid with modern statutes that regulate the formalities of marriage.

#### üí† Statutory Requirement of Age: 
The **Child Marriage Restraint Act, 2017** governs the minimum age for marriage.
    
- **Minimum Age**: **21 years for the male** and **18 years for the female**.
	
- **Effect of Violation**: Contracting a marriage below these ages is a **punishable offense** for the adults involved. However, the marriage itself is **not automatically void**. It remains subject to the "Option of Puberty" and is treated as a valid but potentially voidable contract.
        
#### üí† Statutory Requirement of Registration: 
The **Muslim Marriages and Divorces (Registration) Act, 1974** makes the registration of all Muslim marriages **compulsory**.
    
- **Effect of Non-Registration**: Failure to register a marriage is a punishable offense. However, non-registration **does not invalidate the marriage**. A marriage that fulfills the essential religious requirements (offer, acceptance, witnesses, etc.) is legally valid. The registration certificate (`Nikahnama`) serves as the primary and most reliable **proof** of marriage, essential for enforcing legal rights like dower and maintenance in a court of law.

### üü¢ Part IV: Irregular (`Fasid`) Marriages

Hanafi law makes a unique and crucial distinction between void and irregular marriages.
#### üí† A Void (`Batil`) Marriage
**A Void (`Batil`) Marriage** is a complete nullity. It is an unlawful union from its inception (e.g., marriage within prohibited degrees of consanguinity). It creates **no legal rights or obligations** whatsoever. The children of such a union are illegitimate.

#### üí† An Irregular (`Fasid`) Marriage
**An Irregular (`Fasid`) Marriage** is one that is procedurally flawed but not fundamentally unlawful (e.g., a marriage without witnesses, or a marriage to a fifth wife).
    
- **Legal Effects**:
	
	- **Before Consummation**: It has no legal effect and can be terminated by either party at any time.
		
	- **After Consummation**: Some legal consequences arise. The wife becomes entitled to her specified or proper dower (whichever is less), and she must observe the `iddat` upon separation. Crucially, the **children born of a consummated irregular marriage are legitimate** and have inheritance rights from both parents. However, the parties themselves do not have mutual rights of inheritance.
