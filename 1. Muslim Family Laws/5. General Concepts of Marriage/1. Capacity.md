Of course. While "Capacity" was introduced in the main topic overview, here is a more detailed, standalone explanation of this fundamental concept.

### 5.1 Capacity ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: Capacity (`Ahliyyah`) is a foundational prerequisite for any valid contract, and the marriage contract is no exception. This topic determines who is legally competent to enter into a marriage, who requires a guardian, and what rights a minor has when a marriage is contracted on their behalf. The related "Option of Puberty" (`Khiyar al-Bulugh`) is a key legal right and a frequent subject of examination.

#### Detailed Explanation

In Islamic law, **Capacity (`Ahliyyah`)** refers to the legal competence of a person to enter into a contract and to bear the rights and obligations that arise from it. For a Muslim marriage to be valid, the contracting parties must possess the requisite capacity. This capacity is determined by two primary factors: soundness of mind and attainment of puberty.

**1. Soundness of Mind (`'Aql`)**

A person must be of sound mind at the time of entering the marriage contract. This is because the contract is formed by an intelligent offer and acceptance, which requires the mental faculty to understand the nature and consequences of the act.

- **Legal Effect of Insanity**: A marriage contracted by a person who is certified as legally and permanently insane (`majnun`) is **void (`batil`)**. They are deemed incapable of giving valid consent. The marriage of an insane person can, however, be contracted on their behalf by their legal guardian (`wali`) if it is proven to be in their manifest best interest.
    

**2. Attainment of Puberty (`Bulugh`)**

Puberty marks the end of minority and the beginning of majority for the purposes of marriage in classical Islamic law. It signifies that a person is physically mature and capable of understanding their marital duties.

- **Evidence of Puberty**: Puberty is a factual matter, presumed to have been attained upon the first signs of physical maturity.
    
- **Presumption of Age**: In the absence of evidence to the contrary, Hanafi law presumes that puberty is attained at the **age of 15 years** for both males and females.
    
- **Legal Effect**: Once a person has attained puberty and is of sound mind, they have full legal capacity to contract their own marriage. Under Hanafi law, the consent of a guardian is not required for the validity of the marriage of a person who has reached puberty.
    

**Marriage of Minors and the Option of Puberty (`Khiyar al-Bulugh`)**

A minor who has not reached the age of puberty does not have the capacity to contract their own marriage. However, a marriage can be validly contracted on their behalf by a legal guardian (`wali`).

To safeguard the interests of the minor, Islamic law provides a crucial right known as the **Option of Puberty (`Khiyar al-Bulugh`)**.

- **Definition**: This is the right of a person whose marriage was arranged during their minority to either **ratify** (approve) or **repudiate** (cancel) the marriage upon reaching the age of puberty.
    
- **Codification in Bangladesh**: This classical right is codified and given statutory force in **The Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939**. Section 2(vii) of this Act provides a specific ground for a wife to obtain a judicial divorce.
    
- **Conditions under the 1939 Act**: For a wife to successfully exercise this option in a Bangladeshi court, she must prove the following:
    
    1. The marriage was arranged by her father or another guardian while she was a minor (under the age of 18, as per the statutory definition).
        
    2. She repudiated the marriage before she attained the age of 19.
        
    3. The marriage was **never consummated**.
        

If all three conditions are met, the court can issue a decree of dissolution. This statutory provision is a vital legal remedy for young women trapped in unwanted child marriages.
