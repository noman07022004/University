### 5.7 Irregular marriages ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: The concept of an "irregular" (`fasid`) marriage is a unique and defining feature of the Hanafi school of law, which is followed in Bangladesh. Understanding the distinction between a **void (`batil`)** and an **irregular (`fasid`)** marriage is critical, as it has profound legal consequences, especially concerning the wife's right to dower and, most importantly, the legitimacy and inheritance rights of children.

#### Detailed Explanation

While most schools of Islamic law classify defective marriages into two categories—valid (`sahih`) and void (`batil`)—Hanafi jurisprudence introduces a crucial third, intermediate category: the **irregular (`fasid`) marriage**.

A `Nikah Fasid` is a marriage that is not fundamentally unlawful but is vitiated by a procedural flaw or a violation of a _temporary_ or _relative_ prohibition. It is a defective contract, not a complete legal nullity.

**Grounds for Irregularity**

A marriage is considered irregular, not void, in the following circumstances:

1. **Marriage Without Witnesses**: This is the most common example. The core elements of offer and acceptance exist, but the marriage fails the condition of public declaration.
    
2. **Marriage in Violation of a Relative Prohibition**: This includes:
    
    - **Unlawful Conjunction**: Marrying two women who are sisters (or an aunt and her niece) at the same time.
        
    - **Marrying a Fifth Wife**: When a man who already has four wives marries a fifth.
        
    - **Marrying During `Iddat`**: Marrying a woman who is still in her waiting period from a previous marriage.
        
    - **Difference of Religion**: A marriage between a Muslim woman and a non-Muslim man, or a Muslim man and a woman who is not a `Kitabiyyah` (i.e., not Christian or Jewish).
        

**Legal Effects of an Irregular Marriage**

The legal consequences of a `fasid` marriage are distinct and depend entirely on whether the marriage has been consummated.

**1. Before Consummation** If an irregular marriage has not been consummated, it has **no legal effect**. It is not a binding contract, and either party can terminate it at any time. The woman has no right to dower or maintenance.

**2. After Consummation** If the marriage has been consummated, certain legal effects arise to protect the wife and any children born of the union.

- **Dower (`Mahr`) becomes due**: The wife is entitled to receive either her specified dower (`mahr-i-musamma`) or the proper dower (`mahr al-mithl`), **whichever is less**. She is not entitled to the full specified dower if it is higher than her proper dower.
    
- **`Iddat` is obligatory**: Upon separation, the wife must observe the full `iddat` period as if it were a valid marriage dissolved by divorce.
    
- **Legitimacy of Children is established**: This is the most significant consequence. **Children born of a consummated irregular marriage are legitimate** and have the full right to inherit from both of their parents. The law seeks to protect the status of innocent children from the procedural flaws of their parents' marriage.
    
- **No Mutual Inheritance**: The parties themselves are not considered to be in a valid marital union. Therefore, they have **no right to inherit from each other**.
    

The parties to an irregular marriage are legally obligated to separate as soon as they become aware of the irregularity. If they do not, a Qazi or a court of law has the authority to order their separation.
