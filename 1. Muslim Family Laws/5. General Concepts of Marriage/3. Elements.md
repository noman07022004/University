### 5.3 Elements ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This topic breaks down the marriage contract into its fundamental, constituent parts. In legal analysis, understanding the "elements" (`arkan`) of a contract is crucial for determining its existence and validity. While there is significant overlap with "Formation" and "Conditions," viewing the marriage through its structural elements provides a clear analytical framework.

#### Detailed Explanation

In Islamic jurisprudence, the "elements" (`arkan`) of a contract are its essential, internal components, without which the contract cannot be said to exist legally. While jurists of different schools categorize them in slightly different ways, for practical purposes, the essential elements of a Muslim marriage contract (`Nikah`) can be consolidated as follows:

**1. The Contracting Parties (`Al-'Aqidan`)**

The first essential element is the existence of the two parties to the contract: the groom and the bride. For this element to be fulfilled, the parties must possess the legal **capacity (`ahliyyah`)** to enter the contract. This means they must:

- Be of **sound mind (`'aqil`)**.
    
- Have **attained the age of puberty (`baligh`)**, which is the classical age of majority for marriage.
    

If the parties are minors, this element is fulfilled by their respective legal guardians (`walis`) who contract the marriage on their behalf.

**2. The Expression of Mutual Consent (`Sighah`)**

This is the most critical element, as it is the verbal act that constitutes the contract itself. It is the external manifestation of the mutual consent (`ridha`) of the parties. This element is comprised of two parts:

- **The Offer (`Ijab`)**: A clear proposal of marriage.
    
- **The Acceptance (`Qabul`)**: The corresponding acceptance of the proposal.
    

The expression of consent must be clear, immediate, and unconditional, as detailed in the topic of "Formation." Without the `Sighah`, there is simply no contract.

**3. The Presence of Witnesses (`Shuhud`)**

In the Hanafi school, which governs Muslim personal law in Bangladesh, the presence of witnesses is a non-negotiable requirement for a valid marriage. While some jurists debate whether it's a true "element" (`rukn`) or a "condition" (`shart`), its absence renders the marriage defective. Therefore, for all practical purposes, it functions as an essential element. The marriage contract must be concluded in the presence of at least two adult, sane Muslim males or one male and two females.

**4. Dower (`Mahr`)**

There is a fine jurisprudential distinction as to whether `Mahr` is an element of the contract or an effect of it. The predominant Hanafi view is that it is an essential **effect or consequence** of the marriage, not an element for its formation. This is because a marriage is considered valid even if the dower is not mentioned at the time of the contract (in which case a "proper dower" is imposed by law). However, the wife's right to dower is so fundamental and inseparable from the contract that it is considered a core component of the marital agreement.

**Distinguishing Elements (`Arkan`) from Conditions (`Shurut`)**

To be precise, in classical jurisprudence:

- An **element (`rukn`)** is an internal part of the contract's essence. Its absence means the contract is non-existent (e.g., no offer and acceptance).
    
- A **condition (`shart`)** is an external factor required for the contract's legal validity. Its absence makes the contract defective, but not necessarily non-existent (e.g., in Hanafi law, no witnesses makes the marriage irregular, not void).
    

For the purpose of this course, it is sufficient to understand that the parties, their expressed consent, and the presence of witnesses are the absolute essentials for a valid marriage to be formed.
