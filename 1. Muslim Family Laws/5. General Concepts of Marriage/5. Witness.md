Of course. Let's proceed to the next subtopic on the role of witnesses.

### 5.5 Witness ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: In Sunni Islam, and especially in the Hanafi school that is followed in Bangladesh, the presence of witnesses is an **indispensable condition** for the validity of a marriage. A marriage conducted without witnesses is not valid (`sahih`). Understanding the specific requirements for witnesses is therefore critical to determining the legal status of a `Nikah`, as their absence renders the union defective.

#### Detailed Explanation

In Sunni jurisprudence, a marriage contract is not a private agreement between two individuals; it is a public act with social and legal consequences. The requirement of witnesses (`Shuhud`) is the primary mechanism for ensuring this public character.

**The Purpose of Witnesses**

The insistence on witnesses serves two main functions:

1. **Publicity (`I'lan`)**: The primary purpose is to make a clear distinction between a lawful marriage and a clandestine relationship (`zina` or fornication). The presence of witnesses ensures that the marriage is a declared, open, and socially recognized event.
    
2. **Proof (`Bayyinah`)**: Witnesses serve as the primary legal proof that a marriage took place. In the event of a dispute over the existence of the marriage, or related rights such as dower, maintenance, paternity, or inheritance, the testimony of the witnesses is crucial evidence.
    

**Legal Requirements for Witnesses (Hanafi School)**

For a witness to be legally competent to attest to a marriage contract, they must fulfill several conditions:

- **Number and Gender**: The contract must be witnessed by a minimum of **two individuals**. The required combination is:
    
    - **Two adult males**, OR
        
    - **One adult male and two adult females**.
        
    - The testimony of females alone is not sufficient to validate the solemnization of the marriage.
        
- **Religion**: The witnesses must be **Muslim**. This condition applies when both parties to the marriage are Muslim.
    
- **Capacity**: The witnesses must:
    
    - Be of **sound mind (`'aqil`)**.
        
    - Have **attained the age of puberty (`baligh`)**. A minor cannot be a valid witness to a marriage.
        
    - Be able to **hear and understand** the words of the offer (`Ijab`) and acceptance (`Qabul`) to be able to attest to the formation of the contract.
        

**Legal Effect of the Absence of Witnesses**

This is a key point of law with a specific consequence in the Hanafi school.

- A marriage contracted **without the required number or type of witnesses is not void (`batil`), but it is irregular (`fasid`)**.
    

This means the marriage is procedurally defective but not a complete nullity. It has limited legal effects upon consummation (legitimacy of children and the wife's right to dower), but it does not create mutual rights of inheritance, and the parties are obligated to separate.

**Note on Shia Law** It is important to note that under Shia law, witnesses are **not required** for the validity of a marriage contract. Their presence is recommended for the purpose of proof but is not an essential condition.
