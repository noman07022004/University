### 10.4 Statutory laws of guardianship ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: This is a critical topic of the highest importance. While classical Muslim law provides the foundational principles of guardianship (`Wilayat`) and custody (`Hizanat`), this statutory law provides the **actual legal framework and the ultimate guiding principle** that courts in Bangladesh use to decide all related disputes. The "welfare of the minor" principle established by this statute can override classical rules, making it the most decisive factor in any custody or guardianship case.

#### Detailed Explanation

In Bangladesh, all matters concerning the appointment of guardians and the custody of minor children, regardless of the parties' religion, are governed by the procedural framework of a secular statute.

**The Primary Governing Law: The Guardians and Wards Act, 1890**

This Act provides a comprehensive legal framework for the courts to handle guardianship and custody issues. It does not replace the substantive personal laws (like Muslim law) but provides the uniform procedure and the ultimate principles for judicial decision-making.

**The Proper Forum: The Family Court**

All applications for the appointment of a guardian or for an order of custody are filed in the **Family Court**, established under the Family Courts Ordinance, 1985.

**The Paramount Principle: Welfare of the Minor**

The single most important principle enshrined in the statutory law is the **"welfare of the minor."**

- **Section 17 of the Act** explicitly states that in appointing a guardian, the court's **first and paramount consideration** must be what is consistent with the welfare of the minor.
    
- **What is "Welfare"?** The court interprets "welfare" in its widest possible sense, including the child's moral, religious, intellectual, physical, and emotional well-being. The court considers factors like the child's age, sex, religion, the character of the proposed guardian, and the child's own preference if they are old enough to make an intelligent choice.
    

**Interaction between Statutory Law and Muslim Personal Law**

The Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, directs the court to be "guided by the personal law to which the minor is subject." This means the court must consider the classical rules of Muslim law regarding who is entitled to guardianship (`Wilayat`) and custody (`Hizanat`).

However, the "welfare of the minor" principle is **overriding**.

- If the court finds that following a strict rule of Muslim personal law would be detrimental or injurious to the child's welfare, the court has the full authority to **deviate from that personal law rule**.
    
- **Practical Example**: Under classical Hanafi law, a mother's right to the custody of her son ends when he turns 7. However, a Family Court in Bangladesh may find that a 9-year-old boy's welfare is best served by remaining with his mother (for example, due to strong emotional attachment or the father's inability to provide proper care). In such a case, the court **can and will** grant custody to the mother, thereby prioritizing the child's welfare over the classical rule.
    

In essence, the statutory law establishes the court as the ultimate protector of the child's interests, with the power to make any order it deems necessary to secure their well-being.
