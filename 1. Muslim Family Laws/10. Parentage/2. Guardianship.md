Of course. Let's cover the topic of guardianship.

### 10.2 Guardianship ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: Guardianship (`Wilayat`) is a crucial legal concept dealing with the authority to manage a minor's property and make major life decisions on their behalf. It is fundamentally different from physical custody (`Hizanat`). Understanding this distinction and the strict hierarchy of guardians is essential for matters of a minor's property, finances, and marriage.

#### Detailed Explanation

In Muslim law, it is critical to distinguish between **Guardianship (`Wilayat`)** and **Custody (`Hizanat`)**.

- **Guardianship (`Wilayat`)**: This is the guardianship of a minor's **property and legal rights**. It involves managing their assets and making major life decisions, such as contracting their marriage. This right is primarily vested in the **father and the paternal male line**.
    
- **Custody (`Hizanat`)**: This is the right to the **physical care and upbringing** of a child during their tender years. This right is primarily vested in the **mother and the maternal female line**.
    

An analogy can be drawn where the mother is the primary "nurturer" of the child's person, while the father is the "guardian" of the child's property and legal interests.

**Types and Hierarchy of Guardians**

The law recognizes a strict order of priority for the legal guardianship of a minor.

1. **Natural Guardian**: The law vests this right in specific relatives without any need for a court order. The order is:
    
    - **The Father**: He is the primary and supreme natural guardian.
        
    - **Executor of the Father**: A person appointed by the father in his will (a testamentary guardian).
        
    - **The Paternal Grandfather**: If the father is deceased and has not appointed an executor, the right passes to him.
        
    - **Executor of the Paternal Grandfather**: A person appointed in the paternal grandfather's will.
        
    
    It is a critical point that the **mother, maternal uncle, or other maternal relatives are NOT natural guardians of a minor's property**, although they may have the right to custody.
    
2. **Guardian Appointed by the Court**: In the absence of any natural or testamentary guardian, the court has the authority to appoint a guardian for the minor's welfare under the **Guardians and Wards Act, 1890**.
    

**Powers of a Legal Guardian of Property**

A guardian's powers are not absolute; they are limited by the principle of the minor's benefit.

- **Movable Property**: A legal guardian (father, paternal grandfather) has broad powers to sell or pledge the minor's movable property (e.g., goods, shares) for the minor's needs.
    
- **Immovable Property**: The power to sell or mortgage the minor's immovable property (e.g., land, a house) is **highly restricted**. A legal guardian can only do so in exceptional circumstances, such as:
    
    - If they can get at least double its value.
        
    - If the sale is absolutely necessary for the minor's maintenance.
        
    - If it is necessary to pay the debts of the deceased ancestor from whom the property was inherited.
        

**The `De Facto` Guardian**

- **Definition**: A `de facto` guardian is a person who is not a legal guardian but has voluntarily taken on the care and management of the minor and their property. A mother or an uncle often falls into this category regarding property.
    
- **Powers**: A `de facto` guardian has **no legal power** to transfer or otherwise deal with the minor's property. Any sale or mortgage of a minor's immovable property by a `de facto` guardian is **void**.
