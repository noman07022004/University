Of course. Let's begin the subtopics for "Parentage" with a detailed look at Legitimacy.

### 10.1 Legitimacy ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: Legitimacy (`Nasab`) is the absolute cornerstone of the law of parentage. It is the legal principle that establishes a child's paternity and, consequently, their legal identity and status in relation to their father. This status is the gateway to a child's most crucial rights, including the right to inheritance and maintenance from the father. It is a foundational and critical topic.

#### Detailed Explanation

**The Concept of Legitimacy (`Nasab`)**

Legitimacy, or `Nasab`, is the legal establishment of a child's paternity. In Islamic law, the entire legal relationship between a father and a child hinges on this concept. The law is strongly inclined to presume legitimacy wherever possible to protect the child's status and rights.

**The Primary Presumption of Legitimacy: "The Child Belongs to the Bed"**

The primary method of establishing legitimacy is through the existence of a valid marital relationship between the child's parents. This is based on the famous Prophetic tradition: **"`Al-walad li-l-firash`"** (The child belongs to the bed).

- **Meaning of the Principle**: "The bed" (`firash`) is a metonym for the marriage. This principle creates a powerful legal presumption that any child born to a married woman is the legitimate offspring of her husband. The husband is presumed to be the father, and this presumption can only be rebutted by very strong evidence (such as the husband making a formal accusation of adultery, known as `li'an`).
    
- **Scope of Application**: This presumption applies not only to a **valid (`sahih`) marriage** but also to a consummated **irregular (`fasid`) marriage**.
    

**Conditions for the Presumption of Legitimacy**

For this legal presumption to apply, certain conditions related to the period of gestation must be met:

1. **Minimum Gestation Period**: The child must be born not earlier than **six lunar months** from the date of a valid marriage. A child born before this period is generally not considered the husband's legitimate child.
    
2. **Maximum Gestation Period**: The child must be born within a maximum period after the marriage is dissolved (by death or divorce).
    
    - **Classical Hanafi Law**: The maximum gestation period was considered to be **two lunar years**.
        
    - **The Law in Bangladesh (The Evidence Act, 1872)**: In practice, the courts in Bangladesh are guided by **Section 112 of the Evidence Act, 1872**. This statute creates a conclusive presumption of legitimacy if a child is born:
        
        - During the continuance of a valid marriage, OR
            
        - Within **280 days** after its dissolution, the mother having remained unmarried.
            

**Establishing Legitimacy by Acknowledgement (`Iqrar`)**

This is the secondary method of establishing paternity.

- **Definition**: `Iqrar` is a formal and deliberate acknowledgement by a man that a child of uncertain paternity is his legitimate child.
    
- **Effect**: A valid acknowledgement confers the full status of legitimacy on the child, including all rights of inheritance.
    
- **Conditions for Validity**:
    
    - The acknowledgement must be intended to be serious.
        
    - The paternity of the child must be unknown; one cannot legitimize a child who is known to be illegitimate (i.e., born of `zina`).
        
    - It must be legally and logically possible for the man to be the father (e.g., he must be at least 12.5 years older than the child).
        

**Consequences of Legitimacy**

The status of legitimacy is of immense legal importance.

- **A legitimate child** has a legal relationship with both parents. They have mutual rights of inheritance and the father is legally obligated to provide maintenance.
    
- **An illegitimate child**, in contrast, has no legal relationship with their putative father in Hanafi law. The child cannot inherit from the father, and the father has no legal duty of maintenance. The child's legal relationship and mutual rights of inheritance are only with the mother.
