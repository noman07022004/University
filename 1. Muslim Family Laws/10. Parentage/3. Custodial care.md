Of course. Let's cover the topic of custodial care.

### 10.3 Custodial care ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why Important**: Custodial care, or `Hizanat`, is a very important and frequently litigated area of family law. It deals with the crucial right to the physical upbringing and day-to-day care of a child, which is a central issue in any divorce or separation involving children. The rules clearly define the mother's primary role during a child's formative years.

#### Detailed Explanation

**The Concept of Custodial Care (`Hizanat`)**

**`Hizanat`** refers to the right and duty of **custodial care**—the physical upbringing, nurturing, and day-to-day control of a minor child. It is fundamentally distinct from **guardianship (`Wilayat`)**, which is the authority over a minor's property and major life decisions.

The law recognizes that the mother is naturally the best-suited person to care for a child during their tender years. Therefore, the right of `Hizanat` is primarily vested in her.

**The Mother's Primary Right to Custody**

- **The Rule**: The **mother** has the foremost right to the custody of her young children. This right is considered to be in the child's best interest.
    
- **Effect of Divorce**: The mother's right to custody **continues even after she is divorced**. The father cannot legally take the children away from her during her prescribed term of custody simply because the marriage has ended.
    
- **Father's Duty of Maintenance**: While the child is in the mother's custody, the father, in his capacity as the natural guardian, remains **legally obligated to provide full financial maintenance** for the child.
    

**Duration of the Mother's Custody (Hanafi School)**

The Hanafi school, which is followed in Bangladesh, sets specific age limits for the mother's primary right to custody:

- For a **male child**: The mother's right to custody continues until he attains the age of **7 years**.
    
- For a **female child**: The mother's right to custody continues until she attains **puberty**.
    

After these specified ages, the right to custody transfers to the **father**, as he is the legal guardian (`wali`).

**Succession of Custody**

If the mother is deceased or becomes disqualified from having custody, the right does not automatically pass to the father. The law prioritizes other female relatives, generally in the following order of preference:

1. Mother's mother (Maternal grandmother)
    
2. Father's mother (Paternal grandmother)
    
3. Full sister of the child
    
4. Uterine sister
    
5. Maternal aunt
    
6. Paternal aunt
    

The father's right to custody comes after this list of female relatives is exhausted.

**Grounds for Disqualification from Custody**

A mother or other female custodian can lose her right to `Hizanat` if she:

- **Remarries a "Stranger"**: This is the most common ground. If she marries a man who is not related to the child within the prohibited degrees (i.e., a man who could legally marry the child), she loses her right. The law presumes a "stranger" stepfather may not care for the child's welfare. Her right to custody revives if this second marriage is dissolved.
    
- **Acts Immorally or Neglectfully**: If she is found to be leading an immoral life or is neglectful in caring for the child.
    
- **Prevents Father's Access**: If she moves to a distant place, preventing the father from having reasonable access to his child.
    

**The Overriding Principle: Welfare of the Minor** While these are the classical rules, all custody disputes in Bangladesh are ultimately decided by the **Family Court** under the **Guardians and Wards Act, 1890**. The single, paramount consideration for the court is the **welfare of the minor**. The court has the discretion to deviate from the classical rules if it finds that doing so is in the child's best interest.
