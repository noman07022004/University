## 📌 Parentage ⭐⭐⭐⭐

>**Why Important**: Parentage is the legal foundation of the parent-child relationship. It determines a child's legal identity, legitimacy, and, consequently, their rights to fundamental aspects of life such as inheritance, maintenance, and guardianship. The rules of legitimacy are particularly crucial and form the basis of a person's legal standing within the family and society.

In Islamic law, **parentage** refers to the legal relationship established between a child and their parents. This relationship is the source of a host of mutual rights and obligations. The entire framework of parentage is built upon the cornerstone concept of **legitimacy (`nasab`)**, which is the legal attribution of a child to a specific father.

### 🟢 Part I: Legitimacy (`Nasab`)

Legitimacy is the bedrock of parentage. A child's legitimacy is primarily established through the mother's marriage to the father. The law is designed to strongly presume the legitimacy of a child born during a marriage to avoid bastardizing children.

#### 💠 The Foundational Principle: 
The governing rule is derived from a famous Prophetic tradition: **"The child belongs to the bed" (`al-walad li-l-firash`)**. This means that a child born to a married woman is legally presumed to be the child of her husband. This is one of the strongest presumptions in Islamic law.
    
#### 💠 Conditions for Establishing Legitimacy: 
For this presumption to apply, certain conditions must be met:
    
1. The child must be conceived and born during a **valid (`sahih`) or irregular (`fasid`) marriage**. A child born of a void (`batil`) marriage or outside of any marital union (`zina`) is illegitimate.
	
2. The child must be born after the **minimum period of gestation**, which is recognized as **six lunar months** from the date of the marriage.
	
3. The child must be born within the **maximum period of gestation** after the dissolution of the marriage by death or divorce. In classical Hanafi law, this period was two lunar years.
        
#### 💠 Acknowledgement of Paternity (`Iqrar`): 
If paternity is uncertain, a man can establish it by making a formal **acknowledgement (`iqrar`)** that the child is his. This `iqrar` establishes the child's legitimacy and right to inherit, provided it is not logically or legally impossible (e.g., if it is known that the man and the child's mother could not have been married, or if the man is physically too young to be the father).

### 🟢 Part II: Guardianship (`Wilayat`) and Custody (`Hizanat`)

Once legitimacy is established, the law makes a crucial distinction between the concepts of guardianship and custody.

#### 💠 Guardianship (`Wilayat`): 
This refers to the authority to make major decisions for a minor, particularly concerning their **property**, **education**, and **marriage**. This right belongs primarily to the **father**, who is considered the natural guardian. After the father, the right passes to the paternal grandfather.
    
#### 💠 Custody (`Hizanat`): 
This refers to the **physical care, upbringing, and control** of a child during their tender years. The law recognizes that the mother is best suited for this role.
    
##### 🔹 The Mother's Right: 
The mother has the primary right to the custody of her young children. This right is so fundamental that she retains it even after a divorce.
	
##### 🔹 Duration of Mother's Custody (Hanafi Law): 
The mother is entitled to custody of a **male child until he reaches the age of 7 years** and of a **female child until she reaches puberty**.
	
##### 🔹 Father's Role: 
After these ages, the father, as the natural guardian, is entitled to custody. However, throughout the entire period, the **father remains responsible for the financial maintenance** of the children, even when they are in their mother's care.
	
##### 🔹 Disqualification: 
A mother can be disqualified from her right to custody if, for example, she remarries a man who is not a close relative of the child within the prohibited degrees, or if she is found to be neglectful or immoral. If the mother is disqualified, the right passes to other female relatives in a specific order (e.g., maternal grandmother, paternal grandmother, etc.).

### 🟢 Part III: Statutory Laws of Guardianship in Bangladesh

The classical rules of guardianship and custody are applied in Bangladesh within the framework of modern statutory law.

#### 💠 The Guardians and Wards Act, 1890: 
This is the primary statute that governs the appointment of guardians and all custody disputes. It provides the procedural framework for the courts.
    
#### 💠 The Paramount Principle: Welfare of the Minor: 
The single most important principle of this Act is that in any decision regarding guardianship or custody, the court's paramount consideration must be the **welfare of the minor**.
    
#### 💠 Court's Discretion: 
A Family Court in Bangladesh (which hears these cases under the Family Courts Ordinance, 1985) will consider the rules of Muslim personal law, but it is **not strictly bound** by them. The court has the discretion to make an order that deviates from the classical rules (e.g., allowing a mother to retain custody of her son after the age of 7) if it is convinced that doing so is in the child's best interest. The "welfare of the minor" principle overrides all other considerations.
