## 14. Waqf

**1️⃣ Concept**  
_Waqf_ (plural: _Awqaf_) is the permanent dedication of property for religious, charitable, or pious purposes.

- Once declared, the ownership is transferred to Allah; only the usufruct (benefit) is used for the specified cause.
    
- Typical examples: mosques, madrasas, orphanages, burial grounds.
    

**2️⃣ Types**  
Waqf can generally be categorized as:

- **Public Waqf:** For general public benefit — e.g., mosques, schools, hospitals.
    
- **Private (Family) Waqf or Waqf-alal-Aulad:** Benefits the settlor’s family or descendants first, then charitable causes.
    
- **Conditional or Temporary Waqf:** Some schools accept temporary dedication with conditions, but generally, Waqf is perpetual.
    

**3️⃣ Statutory Provisions**

- In Bangladesh, Waqf is governed under the _Waqf Ordinance, 1962_.
    
- A _Mutawalli_ (trustee) is appointed to administer the Waqf property.
    
- Mutawalli must manage the Waqf honestly and report to Waqf administrators/boards.
    
- Mismanagement or misuse can lead to removal by court orders.
