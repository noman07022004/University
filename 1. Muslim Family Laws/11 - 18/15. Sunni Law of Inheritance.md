## 15. Sunni Law of Inheritance

**1️⃣ General Principles**

- Based mainly on the _Quran_, _Hadith_, _Ijma_ (consensus) & _Qiyas_ (analogy).
    
- Inheritance (_Mirath_) ensures fair distribution among relatives.
    
- Property passes automatically at the time of death — no will needed for Quranic heirs.
    

**2️⃣ Competence**

- The deceased must have been Muslim.
    
- Heirs must not have committed murder of the deceased (barred from inheritance).
    
- Heirs must be alive at the time of the deceased’s death.
    

**3️⃣ Classes of Heirs**

- **Quranic Heirs (_Sharers_)**: Get fixed shares as per Quran (e.g., spouse, parents, children).
    
- **Agnatic Heirs (_Residuaries_)**: Take what remains after sharers get their portions — usually male relatives through the male line.
    
- **Uterine Heirs (_Distant Kindred_)**: Extended relatives when no sharers/residuaries exist.
    

**4️⃣ Quranic Heirs**

- Specific shares: e.g., wife (1/8 or 1/4), husband (1/4 or 1/2), mother (1/3 or 1/6).
    
- Daughters: alone get 1/2, multiple daughters share 2/3.
    
- Sons: residual portion with daughters (2:1 ratio).
    

**5️⃣ Anomalous Cases (‘Awl and Radd)**

- **‘Awl:** When total shares exceed unity, shares are proportionally reduced.
    
- **Radd:** When some heirs do not exist and there is a residue, it’s redistributed to other sharers (except spouse).
    

**6️⃣ Agnatic Heirs**

- Residue goes to nearest male agnate: son, grandson, father’s male relatives.
    
- No fixed share — it varies with what is left.
    

**7️⃣ Uterine Heirs**

- If no Quranic or Agnatic heirs, distant kindred (e.g., maternal uncle) inherit.
    

**8️⃣ Miscellaneous Rules**

- No inheritance between Muslims & non-Muslims.
    
- Illegitimate child cannot inherit from father.
    
- Murderer is disqualified.
    
- Adopted children do not automatically inherit.
