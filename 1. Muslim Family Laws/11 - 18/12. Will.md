## 12. Will

**1️⃣ Concept**  
A _Will_ (_Wasiyat_) in Muslim law is a legal declaration of a person’s intention regarding the distribution of their property after death.  
It allows a Muslim to control up to one-third of their estate by will; the remaining two-thirds must go to legal heirs.

**2️⃣ Restrictions**

- A Muslim cannot bequeath more than **one-third** of their property without the heirs’ consent.
    
- A will cannot deprive any legal heir of their compulsory share without mutual agreement.
    
- Consent from heirs must be explicit if the limit is exceeded.
    

**3️⃣ Types of Will**

- **Conditional Will:** Becomes valid only if certain conditions are met.
    
- **Contingent Will:** Takes effect only on the happening of an uncertain event.
    
- **Implied Will:** Not formalized but deduced from the conduct or statements of the testator (rare in practice).
    

**4️⃣ Statutory Provisions**

- Governed by principles of Islamic law; limited statutory impact.
    
- Registration of a will is not mandatory but recommended to avoid disputes.
    
- In Bangladesh, courts interpret and enforce wills per Muslim personal law and relevant local procedures.
