## 13. Pre-Emption

**1️⃣ Concept**  
_Pre-emption_ (_Shufa_) is the right of a co-sharer or neighbor to buy immovable property in preference to others when the property is sold to an outsider.  
It aims to prevent strangers from intruding into close-knit property holdings and maintain community or family integrity.

**2️⃣ Claimant**  
There are generally three classes of claimants:

1. **Co-sharers in the property** (e.g., co-owners).
    
2. **Participators in amenities** (e.g., right of way, water).
    
3. **Adjacents neighbors**, under certain schools like Hanafi.
    

Priority usually goes in the same order.

**3️⃣ Priority**  
Among multiple claimants, the person with the closest interest has the first right to pre-empt:

- Co-sharer > Participator in amenities > Neighbor.
    

**4️⃣ Demands**  
The claimant must fulfill two formal demands:

- **Immediate Demand (Talab-i-Muwathibat):** Express intention to claim as soon as they learn of the sale.
    
- **Subsequent Demand (Talab-i-Ishhad):** Formal claim in presence of witnesses and the seller/buyer.
    

Failure to comply can defeat the claim.

**5️⃣ Statutory Provisions**

- Pre-emption is mainly governed by Islamic principles but may be supplemented by local land laws and procedural rules.
    
- Courts look for strict compliance with conditions and timing of demands.
