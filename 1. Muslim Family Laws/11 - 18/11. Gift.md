## 11. Gift

**1️⃣ Concept**  
A _gift_ (_hiba_) under Muslim Law means the voluntary transfer of property or a right by one person to another without consideration.  
It is a contract, but one completed by delivery and acceptance, not by payment.

**2️⃣ Types**

- **Hiba:** Absolute gift of property without conditions.
    
- **Ariyat:** Temporary transfer of the use of property without transferring ownership.
    
- **Sadqah:** Charitable gift for religious or pious purposes.
    
- **Hiba-ba-shart-ul-iwaz:** Gift with a condition of return or compensation.
    
- **Mushaa:** Gift of undivided property (generally valid if the property is divisible).
    

**3️⃣ Gift during Death Sickness (Marz-ul-maut)**

- A gift made by a sick person during death-illness is treated like a will.
    
- It cannot exceed one-third of the property unless consented to by heirs.
    

**4️⃣ Gift of Undivided Property**

- Generally disapproved under Sunni Law if the property is indivisible or the division is impractical.
    
- Shia Law is more flexible but still cautious about mushaa gifts.
    

**5️⃣ Statutory Provisions**

- Governed partly by case law and personal law principles.
    
- No statutory registration is required for a valid oral gift, but written gifts of immovable property above a certain value may need registration under the Registration Act.
    
- Delivery of possession is essential.
