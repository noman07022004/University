## 📂 **16. Shia Law of Inheritance**

**Subtopics:**  
1️⃣ **General principles and classification of heirs**

- Basic rules governing inheritance under Shia (mainly Twelver Shia/Imamiya) law.
    
- Emphasis on blood relationship — _Qur’an and direct lineage_ more stressed than agnatic ties.
    
- Concept of “Ta’sib” (agnatic inheritance) _does not apply_ in the same way as in Sunni law.
    

2️⃣ **Shia heirs: Class I, II, and III**

- **Class I:** Parents, children (and their descendants).
    
- **Class II:** Grandparents, brothers, sisters, their descendants.
    
- **Class III:** Paternal and maternal uncles/aunts, cousins.
    
- Priority rule: Higher classes exclude the lower completely.
    

3️⃣ **Anomalies and miscellaneous rules**

- Shares do not revert to distant agnates like in Sunni law — closer blood relatives always preferred.
    
- Doctrine of “Return” (_Radd_) used differently than in Sunni law.
    
- Distinct treatment of spouses — wife always inherits fixed share.
    
- Some sect-specific rules (e.g., exclusion of paternal grandfather if father exists).

**📌 Key Concept:**  
Shia law is stricter about _blood ties_ and does not emphasize agnatic preference. This affects who gets excluded, who shares, and how the residue is distributed.
