### **üìå Introduction**

**Sources of Information** refers to the textual, scholarly, and institutional resources that compile, interpret, and disseminate Islamic legal principles governing family matters, such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, guardianship, and waqf. These sources, primarily books of fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), hadith collections, tafsir (Quranic exegesis), and fatwa compilations, serve as authoritative references for scholars, judges, and legal practitioners to understand and apply Sharia in Muslim family law. In Bangladesh, where the Hanafi school predominates, these resources are crucial for interpreting statutes like the *Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937* and *Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961*, and for resolving disputes in family courts. As a three-star topic, this explanation provides a concise yet thorough overview of the topic‚Äôs scope, key components, and relevance to Bangladesh‚Äôs legal system, preparing you for exam questions and practical applications without the extensive detail required for higher-rated topics.

This topic is essential for law students in Bangladesh to identify reliable sources for studying family law and to understand how historical texts inform modern legal practice. While not as directly applicable as primary sources or ijtihad, it equips you with the tools to navigate the jurisprudential landscape, ensuring you can reference authoritative texts in academic and professional settings.
