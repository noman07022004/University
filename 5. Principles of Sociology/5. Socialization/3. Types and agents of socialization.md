### üìå 5.3 Types and Agents of Socialization ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: This subtopic moves from the theoretical 'how' to the practical 'who' and 'what' of socialization. It identifies the key institutions (agents) and different forms (types) of socialization that shape us throughout our lives.

Socialization is not a single event but a multifaceted, lifelong process. It occurs in different forms throughout our lives and is carried out by various influential groups and institutions in society.

#### üü° Types of Socialization

Sociologists identify several types of socialization based on the stage of life and the nature of the learning process.

##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Primary Socialization: 
- This is the most intense and foundational period of socialization, occurring from birth through early childhood. It is here that we learn language, fundamental cultural values, and the basic norms of social life. The family is the primary setting for this process.
    
##### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Secondary Socialization: 
- This type of socialization takes place outside the home, beginning in later childhood and continuing throughout our lives. It involves learning the appropriate behaviors, attitudes, and values for new situations and roles as we participate in different parts of society, such as school and the workplace.
    
##### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Anticipatory Socialization: 
- This refers to the process of learning and rehearsing for future roles, occupations, and social relationships. It is a way of preparing for a new social status before we actually occupy it.
    
    - **Examples**: An internship to prepare for a career, reading parenting books before becoming a parent, or attending a university orientation.
        
##### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Resocialization: 
- This is the process of discarding former patterns of behavior and accepting new ones as part of a major life transition. Resocialization can be mild (like adjusting to a new workplace culture) or intense and radical. The most dramatic form of resocialization occurs in **total institutions**, a term coined by Erving Goffman. A total institution is a setting in which people are isolated from the rest of society and are subject to tight control by an administrative staff.
    
    - **Examples of Total Institutions**: Military boot camps, prisons, monasteries, and some mental asylums.

#### üü° Agents of Socialization

**Agents of socialization** are the specific individuals, groups, and institutions that are responsible for carrying out the process of socialization.

##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ The Family üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶: 
- The family is the most important agent of socialization. It is the center of a child's life and is responsible for primary socialization. The family teaches basic skills, values, and beliefs and provides a child with their initial social identity and ascribed statuses (such as race, ethnicity, and social class).
    
##### 2Ô∏è‚É£ The School üè´: 
- School is a crucial agent of secondary socialization. Beyond the formal curriculum of academic subjects, schools have a **"hidden curriculum"**‚Äîunstated lessons that teach social norms like punctuality, competition, obedience to authority, and teamwork. Schools socialize children for the impersonal, rule-oriented world they will face as adults.
    
##### 3Ô∏è‚É£ The Peer Group üë´: 
- A peer group is a social group whose members share common interests, social position, and age. Especially during adolescence, the peer group becomes a powerful socializing agent, allowing young people to form an identity separate from their families and learn the norms of their subculture. The desire for conformity to peer group standards can be immense.
    
##### 4Ô∏è‚É£ The Mass Media üì∫: 
- The mass media includes impersonal communications‚Äîsuch as television, the internet, films, and social media‚Äîthat are directed at a vast audience. The media has an enormous influence on our attitudes, values, and perceptions of reality. It presents us with role models and shapes what our culture defines as successful or desirable. In **Bangladesh**, for instance, the influence of television, Bollywood/Dhallywood films, and online platforms like Facebook and YouTube are powerful socializing forces, particularly for the youth.
