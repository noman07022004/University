### üìå 5.2 Theories of Socialization ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: These theories provide the analytical frameworks for understanding _how_ socialization occurs and the self is formed. They explain the psychological and social mechanisms through which an individual internalizes society and develops a personal identity.

The central question for theories of socialization is: how does a biological infant develop a "self"‚Äîa distinct identity with self-awareness and a self-image? The following theories, primarily from the symbolic-interactionist perspective, explain the self as a product of social experience.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Charles Horton Cooley: The Looking-Glass Self

Cooley, a symbolic-interactionist, believed that our sense of self is not an independent creation but is built from our perceptions of how others see us. He termed this process the **looking-glass self**, suggesting that society acts as a mirror. This process involves three steps:

##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ We Imagine Our Appearance to Others: 
We imagine how we present ourselves to another person. This includes our physical appearance, our actions, our words, and our mannerisms.
	    
##### 2Ô∏è‚É£ We Imagine Their Judgment of That Appearance: 
We then try to interpret how the other person is judging us based on our appearance. Do they see us as smart, funny, awkward, or rude? This is our perception of their judgment, which may or may not be accurate.
    
##### 3Ô∏è‚É£ We Experience a Self-Feeling: 
Based on our perception of their judgment, we experience an emotional response. This can be pride, confidence, shame, or embarrassment. This feeling is then integrated into our self-concept.
    

In short, our self-concept is a product of this ongoing cycle of social reflection.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ George Herbert Mead: The Social Self

George Herbert Mead, another key symbolic-interactionist, expanded on Cooley's ideas to develop a more detailed theory of the social self. For Mead, the self is not present at birth but emerges through social interaction and the ability to **"take the role of the other."**

##### üëâ The "I" and the "Me": 
Mead viewed the self as having two dynamic parts:
    
- The **"I"** is the subjective, spontaneous, and impulsive component of the self. It is the active agent, the "I" who acts.
	
- The **"Me"** is the objective, socialized component of the self. It is composed of the internalized attitudes and expectations of others and society. It is the self as an object, as seen from the outside.
	
- The self exists as a continuous internal dialogue between the impulsive "I" and the socially aware "Me."
        
##### üëâ The Generalized Other: 
As we mature, we move from taking the role of specific individuals (**significant others**) to understanding the attitudes and expectations of society as a whole. This composite understanding is what Mead called the **generalized other**. When we consider "what people would think," we are consulting our internalized generalized other.
    
##### üëâ Stages of Self-Development:

###### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Imitation Stage (Birth to age 3): 
Children mimic the actions of others without understanding the underlying meaning.
	
###### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Play Stage (Age 3 to 6):
Children learn to take the role of one significant other at a time (e.g., playing "mommy" or "firefighter").
	
###### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Game Stage (Age 6 onwards): 
Children learn to take the roles of several others simultaneously. In a team game, they must understand their own position in relation to everyone else, internalizing the rules of the game (the generalized other).

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Sigmund Freud: The Psychoanalytic Perspective

While Freud was a psychologist, his theory of personality development is highly influential and offers a contrasting view. For Freud, the self is a product of the conflict between our innate biological drives and the demands of society.

- **The Three Parts of Personality**:
    
    1. The **Id**: The unconscious, instinctual drives present at birth. It operates on the **pleasure principle**, demanding immediate gratification.
        
    2. The **Superego**: Our conscience, which represents the internalized values and norms of society, learned primarily from parents.
        
    3. The **Ego**: The conscious self that operates on the **reality principle**, balancing the conflicting demands of the impulsive Id and the moralistic Superego.
        

In Freud's view, socialization is the process by which society, through the superego, tames the primal urges of the id.
