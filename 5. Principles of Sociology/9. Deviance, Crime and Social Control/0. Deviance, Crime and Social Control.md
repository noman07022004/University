## 📌 Deviance, Crime, and Social Control ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: This topic is fundamental to understanding social order. It explains how societies define and react to rule-breaking behavior, which is a core concern for both sociology and the legal system. It is the study of what happens when social norms are violated.

Every society is built upon a set of shared norms that guide behavior. This topic explores the dynamic interplay between the violation of these norms (**deviance** and **crime**) and society's attempts to enforce them (**social control**). These concepts represent the two sides of a single coin: social order and disorder.

### 🟢 Part A: Understanding Rule-Breaking (Deviance, Crime, and Juvenile Delinquency)

#### 💠 Deviance 😈 
**Deviance** is the recognized violation of cultural norms. The key sociological insight is that deviance is **relative**. No thought or action is inherently deviant; it becomes deviant only in relation to a particular culture's norms. What is considered deviant can vary greatly across time and place. For example, getting a tattoo was once considered highly deviant in many Western cultures but is now mainstream.
    
#### 💠 Crime 🚓 
**Crime** is a specific category of deviance. It is the violation of a society's formally enacted criminal **laws**. The relationship between the two is simple: **all crime is deviance, but not all deviance is a crime.** For example, talking loudly in a library is a deviant act but not a crime. Robbery, however, is both a violation of social norms (deviance) and a violation of the law (a crime).
    
#### 💠 Juvenile Delinquency 
**Juvenile delinquency** refers to the violation of legal standards by a minor (a "juvenile"). Societies typically distinguish between adult criminals and juvenile offenders because young people are considered less responsible for their actions. The juvenile justice system often focuses more on rehabilitation and correction than on punishment.

#### 🟢 Sociological Explanations for Deviance

Sociologists explain deviance not as a personal failing but as a product of social forces.

##### 🔹 Structural-Functionalism (Merton's Strain Theory): 
Argues that deviance occurs when there is a "strain" between culturally approved goals (like wealth) and the socially approved means to achieve them. When people cannot succeed through legitimate means, they may turn to deviant "innovation" (like crime).
    
##### 🔹 Symbolic-Interactionism (Labeling Theory): 
This theory claims that deviance results not from what people do, but from how others **label** that action. Once a person is labeled as "deviant," this can become a powerful **stigma** and a master status, leading them to engage in further deviance.
    
##### 🔹 Social-Conflict Theory: 
This theory argues that laws and norms are not neutral but reflect the interests of the rich and powerful. The powerful have the resources to resist deviant labels, while the actions of the powerless are more likely to be criminalized.

### 🟢 Part B: Maintaining Order (Agents of Social Control)

**Social control** refers to the various attempts by society to regulate people's thoughts and behavior to encourage conformity to norms.

The institutions and individuals that enforce these norms are known as the **agents of social control**. They can be divided into two main types:

- **Informal Social Control** This is the casual, everyday enforcement of norms by people in their daily interactions.
    
    - **Agents**: The primary agents are **family, friends, and the local community**.
        
    - **Mechanisms**: It operates through smiles, praise, ridicule, gossip, or ostracism. In **Bangladesh**, the pressure to conform to the expectations of one's family and local community (_shomaj_) is an extremely powerful form of informal social control.
        
- **Formal Social Control** This is social control that is carried out by authorized agents of the state when informal control is insufficient.
    
    - **Agents**: The main agent is the **criminal justice system**, which is composed of three parts:
        
        1. **The Police**: The primary point of contact between the public and the state's control apparatus.
            
        2. **The Courts**: Determine guilt or innocence based on formal law.
            
        3. **The Corrections System**: Carries out the sentence, including prisons and probation.
            
    - **Mechanisms**: It operates through formal sanctions like arrests, fines, and imprisonment.
        

In conclusion, deviance and social control are in a constant, dynamic relationship that defines a society's moral boundaries and maintains social order.
