Of course. Let's break down the different forms of rule-breaking.

### 9.1 Deviance, Crime, and Juvenile Delinquency ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: This subtopic defines the fundamental concepts of rule-breaking. A clear distinction between these three terms is essential for any sociological or legal analysis of social disorder.

This subtopic defines the different categories of norm violation, moving from the broadest social concept (deviance) to specific legal categories (crime and juvenile delinquency).

#### **1. Deviance**

**Deviance** is the recognized violation of cultural norms. It is the broadest of the three concepts and is defined by social reaction, not by any inherent quality of the act itself.

The most important sociological insight about deviance is that it is **relative**. An act becomes deviant only when a society or a powerful group within it defines it as such. This relativity is evident in several ways:

- **It varies by culture**: What is considered deviant in one society may be perfectly normal in another (e.g., standards of modest dress).
    
- **It varies over time**: What is deviant today may not have been in the past, and vice versa (e.g., smoking in public buildings was once normal but is now deviant).
    
- **It varies by situation**: The same act can be deviant in one context but acceptable in another (e.g., killing another person is a crime, but it is acceptable for a soldier in a time of war).

#### **2. Crime**

**Crime** is a specific type of deviance. It is the **violation of a society's formally enacted criminal laws**. While deviance is a violation of informal social norms, crime is a violation of formal state-enacted rules.

The relationship between deviance and crime can be understood as follows:

- **Acts that are both deviant and criminal**: This is the most common overlap. Murder, robbery, and assault violate both strong social mores and formal laws.
    
- **Acts that are deviant but not criminal**: Many violations of social norms are not illegal. For example, breaking a folkway (like talking with your mouth full) or a more serious more (like cheating on a spouse) is deviant but not a crime.
    
- **Acts that are criminal but not necessarily deviant**: Sometimes, an act is technically illegal, but it is so common that it is not considered socially deviant by many people (e.g., minor speeding on a highway or jaywalking).

#### **3. Juvenile Delinquency**

**Juvenile delinquency** refers to the violation of law or the commission of status offenses by young people below a certain legal age. It is a legal category created to handle youth offenders differently from adults.

There are two key distinctions:

1. **Delinquent Acts**: These are acts that would be considered a crime if committed by an adult (e.g., a 15-year-old committing theft).
    
2. **Status Offenses**: These are acts that are considered violations of the law only because of the individual's status as a minor. These acts are not illegal for adults.
    
    - **Examples**: Truancy (skipping school), violating a public curfew, and underage consumption of alcohol.
        

The rationale for this separate category is the belief that young people have a greater capacity for rehabilitation and are not fully responsible for their actions. In **Bangladesh**, for example, the **Children Act** establishes a separate juvenile justice system with children's courts to handle offenders defined as minors.
