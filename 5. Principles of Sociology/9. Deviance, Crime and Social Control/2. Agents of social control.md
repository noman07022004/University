Of course. Let's cover the agents of social control.

### 9.2 Agents of Social Control ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: This subtopic explains the mechanisms that societies use to maintain order and enforce norms. Understanding these agents is crucial for seeing how conformity is encouraged and deviance is managed.

**Social control** refers to the techniques and strategies for preventing deviant behavior and encouraging conformity to social norms. The individuals, groups, and institutions that carry out this process are known as the **agents of social control**. They operate through both informal and formal means.

#### **1. Informal Social Control**

**Informal social control** is the unofficial, casual enforcement of norms by ordinary people in their everyday interactions. This is the most common form of social control and is often the most effective because it is deeply embedded in our social relationships.

- **Primary Agents**:
    
    - **Family**: The family is the first agent of social control. Parents teach children what is right and wrong through a system of rewards (praise, affection) and punishments (scolding, discipline).
        
    - **Peer Groups**: Friends and peers exert immense pressure to conform to the group's norms, whether it's in fashion, music, or behavior.
        
    - **Community**: The local community, especially in smaller towns or tight-knit neighborhoods, uses tools like gossip and social reputation to regulate behavior. In **Bangladesh**, the influence of the local community (_shomaj_) and the fear of public shame are extremely powerful mechanisms of informal control.
        
- **Mechanisms**: Informal control works through informal sanctions like smiles, praise, ridicule, gossip, and social ostracism (being excluded from the group). We learn to police our own behavior to gain approval and avoid the disapproval of those we care about.

#### **2. Formal Social Control**

**Formal social control** is carried out by authorized agents of the state when informal control is insufficient, particularly when formal laws are violated. It is official, public, and backed by the power of the state.

- **Primary Agent: The Criminal Justice System** The criminal justice system is the most significant agent of formal social control. It is a formal response by police, courts, and prison officials to any alleged violation of the law. Its main components are:
    
    1. **The Police** üëÆ: The police are the primary point of contact between the public and the formal system of social control. They are responsible for enforcing laws and maintaining public order.
        
    2. **The Courts** ‚öñÔ∏è: The courts are a formal arena where the legal guilt or innocence of an individual is determined through an adversarial process. They have the authority to impose formal sanctions.
        
    3. **The Corrections System** ‚õìÔ∏è: This system is responsible for carrying out the sanctions imposed by the courts. Its primary mechanism is the **prison**, but it also includes probation and parole systems.
        
- **Other Formal Agents**: Other institutions also exercise formal control, such as schools (through rules and detentions) and workplaces (through codes of conduct and the threat of being fired).
    

In summary, every society relies on a combination of these agents to maintain order. While the criminal justice system is the most visible agent of control, the subtle and constant pressures of informal control from our family, friends, and community are what shape our behavior most of the time.
