## üìå  2.6 Norms and Values ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: Norms and values are the moral and behavioral compass of a society. They form the core of culture and provide the shared expectations that make social life orderly and predictable. Understanding them is essential for analyzing social control, deviance, and cultural differences.

**Values** and **norms** are the foundational elements of culture that guide social life. While they are deeply interconnected, they are distinct concepts. Values are the abstract ideals that a society holds, while norms are the specific rules of conduct that put those ideals into practice. Together, they create the shared framework that makes social order possible.

### üü° Values

**Values** are the culturally defined standards that people use to judge what is good, desirable, beautiful, and important. They are broad, abstract principles that serve as a general guide for behavior and underlie our beliefs.

- **Characteristics**:
    
    - **Abstract**: Values are general ideas (e.g., freedom, equality, honesty, justice, tradition).
        
    - **Shared**: They are widely held within a culture and contribute to a sense of common identity.
        
    - **Motivational**: They provide the ultimate motivations for people's actions and serve as the basis for their moral judgments.
        
- **Examples**:
    
    - In Western societies, values like **individualism** and **competition** are often prized.
        
    - In many Asian societies, including **Bangladesh**, values such as **collectivism**, **respect for elders**, **family honor**, and **hospitality** are highly significant. These values influence everything from family dynamics to business practices.

### üü° Norms

**Norms** are the specific rules and expectations by which a society guides the behavior of its members. They are the "do's and don'ts" of social life. Norms translate abstract values into concrete behavioral guidelines.

- **The Link to Values**:
    
    - A society that holds the **value** of "respect for elders" will have a **norm** like "offer your seat to an older person on the bus."
        
    - A society that values "education" will have a **norm** against "cheating on exams."
        

#### üëâ Types of Norms

Sociologist **William Graham Sumner** classified norms into three main types based on their degree of importance to a society:

##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Folkways
    
- **Definition**: These are norms that govern routine, casual, and everyday interactions. They are matters of custom and politeness.
	
- **Moral Significance**: They have little moral significance.
	
- **Sanctions for Violation**: Violations are met with mild social disapproval, such as a strange look or being considered rude.
	
- **Examples**: Greeting people you meet, dressing appropriately for an occasion, using proper table manners.
        
##### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Mores (pronounced "more-ays")
    
- **Definition**: These are norms that are widely observed and have great moral significance. They are seen as essential to the core values and well-being of the group.
	
- **Moral Significance**: They distinguish between right and wrong.
	
- **Sanctions for Violation**: Violations evoke a strong negative response from society, such as ostracism or public condemnation.
	
- **Examples**: Prohibitions against theft, dishonesty, adultery, and drug abuse.
        
##### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Laws

- **Definition**: These are norms that have been formally enacted by a political authority (the state) and are enforced through official sanctions.
	
- **Moral Significance**: Laws often codify a society's most important mores (e.g., laws against murder and robbery). However, some laws are practical and lack a strong moral component (e.g., traffic laws).
	
- **Sanctions for Violation**: Violations are met with formal, state-enforced punishments, such as fines, imprisonment, or even death.
	

A special category of mores is **taboos**, which are norms so deeply ingrained that the mere thought of violating them is met with disgust and revulsion. Examples include incest and cannibalism.

### üü° Social Control

Together, norms and values are the basis of **social control**‚Äîthe various methods a society uses to encourage conformity and discourage deviance. When people follow social norms, they are often rewarded with social approval (a positive sanction). When they violate them, they face negative sanctions, ranging from a disapproving glance for breaking a folkway to imprisonment for breaking a law.
