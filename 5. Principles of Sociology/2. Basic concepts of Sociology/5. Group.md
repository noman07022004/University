> **Why Important**: The concept of group is essential in sociology as it focuses on smaller, interactive units within society that shape behavior and social dynamics, often influencing legal issues like collective action or disputes in Bangladesh.

### üìå Introduction

The concept of **group** in sociology refers to a collection of individuals who interact regularly, share common goals or interests, and have a sense of unity or identity. Unlike communities or associations, groups can be formal or informal and vary in size and purpose. For a law student in Bangladesh, understanding groups is crucial because they influence social behavior and legal issues, such as collective bargaining in labor disputes or informal group norms affecting legal compliance. This subtopic explores the definition, characteristics, types, and legal relevance of groups, with examples from Bangladesh‚Äôs social-legal context.

  - **Sense of Unity**: Members feel a collective bond, distinguishing the group from a mere crowd.
- **Relevance to Law**:
  - Groups influence legal systems through collective actions, such as protests or advocacy, impacting laws like the Bangladesh Labour Act, 2006, for workers‚Äô rights.
  - **Example**: A group of garment workers in Dhaka forming a union to negotiate better wages, engaging with labor laws.
- **Significance**: Helps law students understand how group dynamics shape legal disputes and collective behavior in Bangladesh.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Characteristics of Group

  - Groups unite around common objectives, such as social change or mutual support.
  - **Example**: A women‚Äôs self-help group in rural Bangladesh promoting economic empowerment, aligning with microfinance laws.
- ##### Group Identity

  - **Example**: A religious group in Chittagong celebrating Eid, influencing local legal practices around religious events.
- ##### Norms and Roles
  - Groups have internal rules and roles (e.g., leader, member) that guide behavior.
  - **Example**: A community group resolving disputes through informal norms, impacting formal legal processes like shalish.
- ##### Dynamic Nature
  - Groups evolve through internal changes or external pressures, affecting their legal interactions.
  - **Example**: Urban youth groups in Bangladesh adopting digital activism, raising issues under the Digital Security Act, 2018.
- **Relevance to Law**:
  - These characteristics show how groups influence legal compliance, disputes, or advocacy, requiring law students to understand their role in Bangladesh‚Äôs legal system.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Types of Group

- ##### Primary Groups
  - Small, intimate groups with close, personal relationships, such as families or close friends.
  - **Example**: A family in rural Bangladesh making decisions about marriage, governed by personal laws like the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961.
  - **Relevance to Law**: Primary groups influence family-related legal issues, such as inheritance or child custody disputes.
- ##### Secondary Groups
  - Larger, more formal groups with specific goals, such as professional or voluntary organizations.

  - **Relevance to Law**: Secondary groups engage with legal systems through advocacy or disputes, like labor strikes.
- ##### In-Groups and Out-Groups
  - In-groups share a strong sense of identity, while out-groups are seen as outsiders.

  - **Relevance to Law**: Group identities can lead to discrimination or conflict, requiring legal interventions for social justice.
- ##### Reference Groups
  - Groups individuals use as a standard for behavior or comparison, even if they‚Äôre not members.
  - **Example**: Urban youth in Dhaka emulating global activist groups, influencing legal debates on freedom of expression.
  - **Relevance to Law**: Reference groups shape attitudes toward legal compliance or social change.
