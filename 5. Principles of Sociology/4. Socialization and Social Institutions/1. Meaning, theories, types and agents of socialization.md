### üìö **Major Theories of Socialization:**

#### 1. **Mead‚Äôs Theory of the Social Self**

- **George Herbert Mead** believed self develops through **interaction**.
    
- Introduced the idea of the **"I" (individual response)** and the **"Me" (social self)**.
    
- Children develop self by **taking the role of others** (e.g., playing as teacher or parent).
    

#### 2. **Cooley‚Äôs Looking Glass Self**

- **Charles Horton Cooley**: Self develops through how we **believe others see us**.
    
- Three steps:
    
    1. We imagine how we appear to others.
        
    2. We imagine their judgment.
        
    3. We develop feelings about ourselves.
        

#### 3. **Freud‚Äôs Psychoanalytic Theory**

- **Sigmund Freud**: Personality has three parts:
    
    - **Id** (instincts),
        
    - **Ego** (reality),
        
    - **Superego** (morals).
        
- Socialization shapes how these parts balance.
