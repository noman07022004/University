## üìå 4.2 Social Structure in Global Perspective ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: In an era of globalization, no society exists in isolation. This perspective is essential for understanding how a nation's internal structure and destiny are shaped by its position within a larger, global system of power and inequality.

The concept of social structure is not limited to a single society. In our increasingly interconnected world, sociologists analyze a broader **global social structure**‚Äîthe patterns of relationships, power dynamics, and inequalities that exist _between_ nations. This perspective moves beyond studying societies as separate entities and instead views them as interconnected parts of a larger global system.

### üü° World-System Theory: The Dominant Framework

The most influential model for understanding the global social structure is **World-System Theory**, developed by sociologist **Immanuel Wallerstein**.

- **Core Idea**: Wallerstein argued that we should not think of the world as a collection of independent countries, but as a single, integrated **world-economy**. This capitalist world-system has been developing for centuries and is characterized by a global division of labor that creates a hierarchy of nations.
    

This global structure is composed of three interconnected tiers:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ The Core

- **Description**: These are the wealthy, powerful, and highly industrialized nations that dominate the world-system.
    
- **Role**: They own and control the majority of the world's capital and advanced technology. They specialize in high-skill, capital-intensive production and are the primary beneficiaries of the global economy.
    
- **Examples**: The United States, Japan, Germany, and other nations in Western Europe.
    

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ The Periphery

- **Description**: These are the low-income, less-developed nations that are economically and politically dependent on the core.
    
- **Role**: Their economies are specialized in providing cheap labor and raw materials (e.g., agricultural products, minerals) to the core and semi-periphery. They have little industrialization and are often politically unstable. This relationship is one of exploitation, as wealth is continuously drained from the periphery to the core.
    
- **Examples**: Many nations in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Latin America and Asia.
    

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ The Semi-Periphery

- **Description**: These are middle-income, industrializing nations that are positioned between the core and the periphery.
    
- **Role**: They have a mix of economic activities, acting as a "buffer zone." They are exploited by the core but, in turn, exploit the periphery. They have a greater degree of political and economic autonomy than the periphery and can sometimes be upwardly mobile.
    
- **Examples**: Nations like Brazil, India, China, and South Africa.

#### üëâ Impact on National Social Structures

A nation's position in this global hierarchy profoundly shapes its internal social structure. For a country like **Bangladesh**, which has historically occupied a peripheral or is transitioning to a semi-peripheral role, the global structure has a direct impact:

- **Economic Structure**: The economy is heavily reliant on export-oriented industries that serve the needs of core nations, such as the Ready-Made Garment (RMG) sector.
    
- **Class Structure**: This creates a specific internal class structure, with a large industrial working class and a business elite whose fortunes are tied to global trade.
    
- **Dependency**: The nation's economic health becomes vulnerable to the demands and economic fluctuations of the core countries.
    

In conclusion, the global perspective reveals that the social structure of any given country cannot be understood in isolation. It is deeply embedded in and shaped by a larger global system of economic power and dependency.
