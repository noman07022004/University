## 📌 Social Stratification and Inequality ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: This topic addresses the fundamental issue of structured inequality in society. It explains how societies are divided into hierarchical layers and the consequences of this division for people's lives. It is a core concept for understanding power, privilege, and social justice.

All complex societies are characterized by a system of social ranking. **Social stratification** is the system by which a society ranks categories of people in a hierarchy, leading to structured **social inequality**—the unequal distribution of wealth, power, and prestige. This topic can be understood as a three-part process: the system itself (stratification), its outcome (inequality), and the movement within it (mobility).

### 🟢 Part A: The System – Social Stratification

This part covers the definition, characteristics, and forms of the system of social ranking.

- **Definition and Characteristics**: Social stratification is not about individual differences in talent or effort; it is a **property of society itself**. Its key characteristics are:
    
    1. **It is a trait of society, not individuals**: Inequality is built into the social structure, not just a result of personal abilities.
        
    2. **It persists over generations**: Social position is often passed down from parents to children, perpetuating privilege and disadvantage.
        
    3. **It is universal but variable**: All societies stratify their members, but the _criteria_ for ranking and the _degree_ of inequality vary.
        
    4. **It is supported by ideology**: Every system of inequality is justified by a set of beliefs (an ideology) that defines the arrangements as fair (e.g., the belief in meritocracy).
        
- **Forms of Stratification**: Societies have been stratified in several ways throughout history:
    
    1. **Slavery**: An extreme form of inequality where some people are owned as property by others.
        
    2. **The Caste System**: Social stratification based on **ascription**, or birth. A person's rank is fixed for life, and social mobility is nearly impossible. This system is most closely associated with traditional India.
        
    3. **The Class System**: Social stratification based on both birth (ascription) and individual achievement (merit). This system is more open, allowing for **social mobility**. A person's social class is determined by their economic position, which is influenced by factors like income, wealth, and occupation. This is the dominant form of stratification in modern societies, including **Bangladesh**, where family background (_bangsho_) and economic achievement both play crucial roles.

### 🟢 Part B: The Consequence – Social Inequality

This is the direct outcome of the system of stratification. Social inequality refers to the unequal distribution of valued resources.

- **Dimensions of Inequality**:
    
    1. **Income and Wealth**: **Income** is the money earned from work or investments. **Wealth** is the total value of all assets (property, stocks, savings) minus debts. Wealth inequality is always far greater than income inequality.
        
    2. **Power**: The ability to achieve one's goals and influence others, even against their will.
        
    3. **Prestige**: The social honor and respect attached to a person's social position. In modern societies, occupational prestige is a key indicator of social standing.

### 🟢 Part C: The Movement – Social Mobility

This concept describes the movement of individuals or groups within the stratification system.

- **Meaning and Types**: **Social mobility** is a change in one's position in the social hierarchy. The degree of social mobility is a key indicator of how open or rigid a society's class system is.
    
    - **Vertical Mobility**: Movement up or down the social ladder (e.g., a factory worker's son becoming a doctor).
        
    - **Horizontal Mobility**: A change in position at the same social level (e.g., an engineer at one company moving to another).
        
    - **Intergenerational Mobility**: A change in social position that occurs between generations (comparing a child's social class to their parents').
        
    - **Intragenerational Mobility**: A change in social position that occurs during a person's lifetime.
        

In summary, **social stratification** is the system of ranking that creates **social inequality**, and **social mobility** describes the movement of people within that system. These concepts are fundamental to understanding how opportunities and life chances are distributed in any society.
