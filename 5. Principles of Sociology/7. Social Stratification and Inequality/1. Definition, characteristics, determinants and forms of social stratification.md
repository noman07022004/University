Of course. Let's do a deep dive into the foundational concepts of social stratification.

### 7.1 Definition, Characteristics, Determinants, and Forms of Social Stratification ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: This subtopic provides the complete architectural blueprint of social inequality. It defines the concept, outlines its universal principles, and categorizes its major historical forms, which is essential for any analysis of social structure.

This subtopic deconstructs the system of social inequality into its core components: what it is, how it operates, what causes it, and the shapes it takes.

#### **1. Definition**

**Social stratification** is a system by which a society ranks categories of people in a hierarchy based on their unequal access to valued resources such as wealth, power, and prestige. The term "stratification" is borrowed from geology, which describes the Earth's layers (strata) of rock. Sociologically, these layers are the different social classes or castes that make up a society's structure.

Crucially, this is a system of **structured inequality**, meaning it is a built-in feature of the social system, not just a random outcome of individual differences.

#### **2. Characteristics**

All systems of social stratification, regardless of their form, share four universal principles:

1. **It is a trait of society, not individuals.** Stratification is not a reflection of individual talent or effort. While personal abilities do play a role, the system itself is what shapes life chances. For example, being born into a wealthy family provides advantages that have nothing to do with one's innate abilities.
    
2. **It persists over generations.** The system is durable and is passed down from parents to children. This process, known as **social reproduction**, is why class status and privilege (or disadvantage) tend to be inherited.
    
3. **It is universal but variable.** Every known complex society has some form of stratification, but the criteria for ranking people differ. In some societies, rank is based on wealth; in others, it might be based on age, military prowess, or religious purity.
    
4. **It is supported by an ideology.** Stratification is maintained not just by unequal resources, but also by a set of widely held beliefs, or an **ideology**, that justifies the existing social arrangement as fair and natural. For example, a class system is often justified by the ideology of **meritocracy**.

#### **3. Determinants**

A person's position within the social hierarchy is determined by two main factors:

- **Ascription**: Placement in the hierarchy is based on characteristics an individual is born with and cannot control, such as family background, caste, race, or gender. In a "closed" system, ascription is the primary determinant.
    
- **Achievement**: Placement is based on personal merit, effort, and choice. In an "open" system, achievement is the primary determinant.
    

In reality, all stratification systems are a mix of both. Even in modern "open" class systems, your ascribed status at birth heavily influences what you can achieve.

#### **4. Forms of Stratification**

Societies have historically been organized around two main types of stratification systems:

- **The Caste System (A "Closed" System)**
    
    - **Description**: A rigid system of social stratification based entirely on ascription or birth.
        
    - **Characteristics**:
        
        - **Fixed Hierarchy**: A person's rank is determined at birth and cannot be changed. Social mobility is extremely limited.
            
        - **Endogamy**: Individuals are required to marry within their own caste.
            
        - **Segregation**: Social life is strictly segregated, with rules dictating interactions between castes.
            
        - **Ideological Justification**: It is typically justified by strong religious or traditional beliefs (e.g., the Hindu concept of dharma and karma in traditional India).
            
- **The Class System (An "Open" System)**
    
    - **Description**: A more open system of stratification based on both birth and individual achievement.
        
    - **Characteristics**:
        
        - **Social Mobility**: Individuals have the opportunity to move up or down the social ladder.
            
        - **Fluid Boundaries**: The lines between social classes are not rigid and can be crossed.
            
        - **Economic Basis**: A person's class is primarily determined by their economic standing (income, wealth, occupation).
            
        - **Ideological Justification**: It is justified by the ideology of **meritocracy**—the belief that social position is earned through personal talent and effort.
            
    - In **Bangladesh**, the class system is the dominant form of stratification, but it is deeply influenced by ascriptive factors like family lineage (_bangsho_), inherited property, and social connections.
