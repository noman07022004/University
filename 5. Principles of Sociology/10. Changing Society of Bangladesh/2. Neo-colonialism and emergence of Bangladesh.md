### 10.2 Neo-colonialism and the Emergence of Bangladesh ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: This subtopic explains the direct causes of the Bangladesh Liberation War. It applies the concept of neo-colonialism to understand the 24-year period of Pakistani rule and the rise of Bengali nationalism.

After the end of British rule in 1947, East Bengal became the eastern province of a new country, Pakistan. The period from 1947 to 1971 is analyzed by sociologists as a form of **internal neo-colonialism**, where the politically and militarily dominant West Pakistan treated East Pakistan as a subordinate territory.

**Neo-colonialism** is a form of indirect colonial control. Instead of direct military and political rule, it is the use of economic, political, and cultural pressures to dominate a less powerful state or region.

#### **Dimensions of Neo-colonial Rule (1947-1971)**

The relationship between West and East Pakistan was characterized by systematic exploitation and domination.

**1. Economic Exploitation** üí∞ This was the core of the neo-colonial relationship.

- **Resource Drain**: East Pakistan, primarily through its jute exports, earned the vast majority of Pakistan's foreign currency.
    
- **Disparate Development**: This revenue, instead of being reinvested in the East, was used to finance the industrialization and infrastructural development of West Pakistan. East Pakistan was treated as a resource-rich colony whose purpose was to fund the development of the West. This created a massive and growing economic disparity between the two wings.
    

**2. Political Domination** üèõÔ∏è Despite having the majority of the country's population, East Pakistan was systematically marginalized from power.

- **Centralized Authority**: The capital, the central government, the military headquarters, and the senior civil service were all located in and dominated by West Pakistanis.
    
- **Suppression of Democracy**: The political will of the Bengali people was consistently ignored. The most blatant example was the refusal of the West Pakistani military junta to hand over power to the Awami League after it won a decisive majority in the 1970 general election.
    

**3. Cultural Subordination** üó£Ô∏è The most potent symbol of this domination was the assault on Bengali culture.

- **The Language Movement of 1952**: The central government's attempt to impose Urdu as the sole national language on the Bengali-speaking majority was perceived as an existential threat to Bengali identity. The protests and the killing of student demonstrators on February 21, 1952, became a foundational event for Bengali nationalism. This day is now recognized worldwide as International Mother Language Day.

#### **The Emergence of Bangladesh**

These decades of systematic oppression fostered a powerful and unified **Bengali nationalist** identity. The economic disparity, political disenfranchisement, and cultural suppression culminated in a mass movement for autonomy.

The refusal to honor the 1970 election results and the subsequent brutal military crackdown on the night of March 25, 1971, was the final trigger. This led to the declaration of independence and the beginning of the nine-month-long **Bangladesh Liberation War**. After a devastating conflict, the Pakistani forces surrendered on December 16, 1971, and Bangladesh emerged as a sovereign nation.
