### 🟢 Social Structure of Colonial Bengal

The foundation of modern Bangladesh's social structure was laid during the British colonial period (roughly 1757-1947). The British introduced profound changes that dismantled the pre-colonial order and created a new, rigid social hierarchy.

- **New Economic Structure**: The British integrated Bengal's economy into the global capitalist system, but in a subordinate role. Bengal became a supplier of raw materials (like jute and indigo) for British industries and a captive market for British manufactured goods.
    
- **The Permanent Settlement Act of 1793**: This was arguably the most significant structural change. To ensure a stable source of revenue, the British created a new class of landowners, the **Zamindars**, who were made permanent proprietors of the land in exchange for a fixed tax payment to the colonial state.
    
    - **Consequences**: This act created a rigid, three-tiered rural class structure:
        
        1. **The Zamindars**: A wealthy, landed aristocracy loyal to the British.
            
        2. **The Jotedars**: A class of intermediate tenants or wealthy peasants.
            
        3. **The Ryots**: The vast majority of the population, reduced to the status of landless peasants and sharecroppers with little to no security.
            
- **Emergence of a New Middle Class**: The colonial administration required a class of educated locals to serve as clerks and officials. This led to the rise of a Western-educated, urban middle class known as the **_bhadralok_**.
    

This colonial structure was characterized by a dependent agrarian economy, extreme rural inequality, and the creation of a new urban elite.

### 🟢 Neo-colonialism and the Emergence of Bangladesh

After the end of British rule in 1947, Bengal was partitioned, and its eastern part became East Pakistan. The period from 1947 to 1971 is often analyzed by sociologists as a form of **internal neo-colonialism**. **Neo-colonialism** is a form of indirect control where a powerful state uses economic and political pressures to control a less powerful one.

In this case, the politically and militarily dominant West Pakistan treated East Pakistan as a colony:

- **Economic Exploitation**: East Pakistan earned the majority of the country's foreign currency (primarily through jute exports), but this revenue was overwhelmingly used to fund industrial development in West Pakistan.
    
- **Political Domination**: The central government, military, and civil bureaucracy were dominated by West Pakistanis, marginalizing the Bengali population from political power.
    
- **Cultural Subordination**: The attempt to impose Urdu as the sole national language was seen as an attack on Bengali culture. This sparked the **Language Movement of 1952**, a key event that planted the seeds of Bengali nationalism.
    

This systematic exploitation and subordination led to a growing nationalist movement, which culminated in the **Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971** and the emergence of Bangladesh as an independent nation.

### 🟢 Social Problems of Bangladesh

Many of the contemporary social problems facing Bangladesh are legacies of these historical structures. While the nation has made remarkable progress since independence, it continues to grapple with significant challenges:

- **Poverty and Inequality**: Despite a rapidly growing economy, a significant gap remains between the rich and the poor. Inequality in land ownership, a direct legacy of the colonial system, persists in rural areas.
    
- **Rapid and Unplanned Urbanization**: Driven by industrialization (especially in the garment sector) and rural landlessness, cities like Dhaka have experienced explosive growth, leading to overcrowding, the proliferation of slums, severe pollution, and immense pressure on public services.
    
- **Corruption**: A pervasive institutional problem that hinders effective governance, slows economic development, and undermines the rule of law.
    
- **Environmental Vulnerability**: As a low-lying delta, Bangladesh is one of the world's most vulnerable nations to the effects of climate change, including rising sea levels, increased flooding, and more powerful cyclones.
