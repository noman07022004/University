### 10.3 Social Problems of Bangladesh ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

> **Why Important**: This subtopic applies a sociological lens to the real-world challenges facing contemporary Bangladesh. It connects the historical and theoretical concepts from the course to the lived realities and policy debates of the nation.

A **social problem** is a condition that undermines the well-being of some or all members of a society and is a matter of public controversy. Bangladesh, like all nations, faces a unique set of social problems that are deeply rooted in its history, social structure, and rapid pace of development. A sociological perspective helps us understand these issues not as individual failings but as consequences of larger social forces.

#### **Key Social Problems in Bangladesh**

**1. Poverty and Economic Inequality** üí∞ While Bangladesh has made remarkable strides in reducing poverty, significant economic inequality remains a core social problem.

- **Sociological Perspective**: This is a structural issue, not just a lack of income. It is rooted in the historical legacy of landlessness from the colonial era and is perpetuated by unequal access to key resources like quality education, healthcare, and job opportunities. The gap between the urban rich and the rural and urban poor is a stark manifestation of the country's class structure.
    

**2. Rapid and Unplanned Urbanization** üèôÔ∏è The massive and rapid growth of cities, particularly Dhaka, is one of the most pressing social problems.

- **Sociological Perspective**: This is a classic consequence of industrialization, reflecting a large-scale shift from a rural, agrarian society to an urban, industrial one. "Push" factors (rural poverty, river erosion) and "pull" factors (factory jobs) drive this migration.
    
- **Manifestations**: This rapid growth has outpaced the development of infrastructure, leading to severe traffic congestion, the proliferation of slums (_bostis_), immense pressure on public services like water and sanitation, and high levels of environmental pollution.
    

**3. Corruption** ‚öñÔ∏è Corruption is a pervasive social problem that affects many levels of society and governance.

- **Sociological Perspective**: From a sociological viewpoint, corruption is a form of institutionalized **deviance**. It undermines the **rational-legal authority** of the state by creating a system where rules are bypassed through bribery and nepotism.
    
- **Consequences**: It erodes public trust in institutions, hinders economic development by misallocating resources, and worsens social inequality, as the wealthy and well-connected can operate outside the law while the poor cannot.
    

**4. Environmental Vulnerability** üåä Bangladesh's geography makes it extremely vulnerable to environmental problems, which are a major social issue.

- **Sociological Perspective**: This highlights the conflict between the drive for economic development and environmental sustainability. As a low-lying deltaic nation, Bangladesh is on the front lines of global **climate change**, facing threats from rising sea levels, increased frequency and intensity of cyclones, and flooding.
    
- **Social Impact**: These environmental threats disproportionately affect the poorest and most vulnerable populations, especially rural farmers and coastal communities, thus exacerbating existing social inequalities.
