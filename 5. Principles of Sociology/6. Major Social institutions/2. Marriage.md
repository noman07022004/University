### 📌 6.2 Marriage ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> **Why Important**: Marriage is the primary social institution that creates new kinship bonds and legitimizes family formation. Understanding its forms and functions is crucial for analyzing family structures, social norms, and the regulation of social life.

In sociology, **marriage** is defined as a legally and socially sanctioned union between individuals that establishes a new set of rights and obligations between them, between them and their children, and between them and their in-laws. It is the formal, institutionalized gateway to creating a family. While the emotional bond between partners is important, sociology studies marriage as a public social institution that organizes many aspects of life.

#### 🟡 Functions of Marriage

Marriage serves several crucial functions in society:

- **Legitimizing Family Formation**: It is the socially approved way to create a new family unit and legitimize the status of children.
    
- **Regulating Sexual Behavior**: It provides a normative framework for sexual activity and reproduction.
    
- **Establishing Kinship and Descent**: It creates a new set of kin (the family of in-laws) and is fundamental to systems of **descent**—the way societies trace kinship over generations (e.g., **patrilineal** through the father, **matrilineal** through the mother, or **bilateral** through both).
    
- **Providing Economic Cooperation**: Historically and in many societies today, marriage is a practical union that involves a pooling of resources and a division of labor to ensure economic stability.

#### 🟡 Cultural Patterns of Marriage

The institution of marriage varies significantly across cultures, particularly in terms of who can marry whom and how many partners one can have.

**1. Mate Selection Norms**

- **Endogamy**: The practice of marrying _within_ a particular social group or category. Societies often expect people to marry within the same race, ethnicity, religion, or social class.
    
- **Exogamy**: The practice of marrying _outside_ a particular social group. The universal incest taboo, which requires us to marry outside our immediate family, is the most basic form of exogamy.
    

**2. Number of Spouses**

- **Monogamy**: A marriage uniting two partners. This is the only legally sanctioned form in most industrial nations. The pattern of marrying, divorcing, and remarrying is known as **serial monogamy**.
    
- **Polygamy**: A marriage uniting a person with two or more spouses.
    
    - **Polygyny**: The marriage of one man to two or more women. Historically, this has been the most common form of polygamy.
        
    - **Polyandry**: The marriage of one woman to two or more men. This form is extremely rare.
        

**3. Residential Patterns**

- **Patrilocality**: The married couple lives with or near the husband's family.
    
- **Matrilocality**: The married couple lives with or near the wife's family.
    
- **Neolocality**: The married couple sets up their own residence apart from both families. This is the ideal in most high-income nations.
